1	What Doesn’t Kill You...	Long before the age of sterilization, antibiotics or anaesthetic, medical practice in colonial Australia could be both gruesomely rudimentary and oddly progressive.  Mortality rates were high, dysentery, typhoid and venereal disease were common and a healthy diet and appropriate medical supplies were hard to come by.  Spear removal and vaccination against smallpox were just two of the more unusual services provided by Colonial Surgeon, John Harris.	John Harris arrived in the Colony of New South Wales in July 1790 on board the Surprize, a convict ship with the notorious Second Fleet. Harris was shocked by the squalid conditions, disease, starvation and misery suffered by the convicts.  Upon arrival he settled at Parramatta and in 1793 purchased land from James Ruse and built the cottage that still stands at Experiment Farm in 1834.\n\nOnly three months after his arrival, Harris accompanied Governor Arthur Phillip on a brief expedition by boat to Manly Cove. Phillip hoped to meet up with his friend and Eora man, Bennelong.  The group was well received but a misunderstanding occurred and Phillip was speared in the shoulder.  Harris offered assistance until senior surgeon, William Balmain, could tend the wound. \n\nLater, in 1818, at the age of 64 he accompanied John Oxley’s expedition along the Macquarie River as the expedition’s surgeon.  One member of the party, William Blake, suffered two deep spear wounds when attacked by a lone aboriginal man.  Harris was able to remove the spears and dress the wounds.  Oxley had feared Blake would not recover but later wrote to Governor Macquarie commending Harris and his invaluable assistance on the journey.\n\nThe medical chest and textbooks on display at Experiment Farm Cottage provide a fascinating insight into the common medical treatments of the time. \nThe Simple ointment contained was used for the treatment of chafed, cracked skin, often suffered by convict labourers.  Aperient pills and Calomel, a compound made with mercury, were common laxative treatments and indicative of the need to counter the meagre, low-fibre rations given to the convicts.  Harris’s chest also contained catgut for stitching wounds and re-usable needles.\n\nThe colony was progressive in establishing a vaccination program against smallpox and in 1804 Harris placed an announcement in the Sydney Gazette, announcing his availability to “inoculate with vaccine injection”.	“Harris’s chest also contained catgut for stitching wounds and re-usable needles.”	1798-01-01	\N
2	The Ghost of the Governors Wife	World Heritage listed Government House is a special place, not only because it is one of Australia’s oldest surviving public buildings, but also because of the many illustrious people who called it their home. The convict-built Georgian mansion which stands in 200 acres of parkland was the country residence for ten governors and where the last governor’s wife, Lady Mary Caroline Fitzroy met her untimely and tragic death.	\nLady Mary Caroline Fitzroy the wife of Governor Charles Fitzroy arrived in colonial Australia in 1846. The daughter of the Duke of Richmond, she was well known in the colony for her charm and generosity and the Governor Fitzroy was every bit a man of the British Empire. The Fitzroy’s were seen as something of a relief compared to Gipps caustic ways.\n\nGovernor Fitzroy was well known for his good humour and joviality as he juggled the backbiting and continual conflict on the matter of the continued transportation of convicts.  Fitzroy, rarely involved himself in the nitty gritty detail of public debate and focused instead on pleasing the people.  \n\nThe aristocratic Fitzroy governorship took their ceremonial duties and Lady Fitzroy, who was probably better connected than her husband, was well-liked and known for her cheerful spirit and generosity. She assisted the church through the loan of a carriage, rallied support for fundraisers and was fond of both hosting and attending the dinners and balls that accompanied her role. \n\nWhen attending these many ceremonial occasions, Fitzroy a keen horseman often chose to drive the coach and horses, which not only served as a mode of transport, but also added a certain pageantry to his role. \n\nIn the summer of 1847 the Fitzroy’s were to attend a wedding in Sydney.  Much preparation went into the journey of some 20 miles and as the carriage drew up to pick up her ladyship, the horses were observed as being skittish and high spirited.\n\nBefore the Governor had time to settle himself and take the reins the horses galloped at speed down the hill.  Lady Mary’s screams could be heard as she attempted to stand up in the carriage, then fainted as the carriage overturned.  The carriage struck the oak trees sending Lady Mary crashing to the ground, smashing her skull. The governor looked over on in horror as she took her dying breath muttering ‘Sir Charles...’\n\nTake a visit and walk the driveway to visit the place where Lady Mary met her untimely death, some say you can still hear her screams.  	“Lady Mary’s screams could be heard as she attempted \nto stand up in the carriage, then fainted as the carriage overturned.”	1799-01-01	1820-01-01
3	Ancient Aboriginal and Early Colonial Landscape	Beneath the foundations and footpaths of downtown Parramatta lies a sandbank. Broad and deep, and known as the Parramatta Sand Sheet, the sandbank is one of Parramatta’s richest archaeological sites. Laid down over 30,000 years ago by fluvial action, a river erosion process where sand and sediment is deposited into bars, points and flood plains, the sandbank tells us much about Aboriginal life and early European settlement.\n	The fluvial sand terrace arcs inland from the river to Hassall Street and in April 1788 Governor Phillip named it The Cresent. Now defined by George Street at its northern perimeter, the sandbank stretches to Robin Thomas Reserve to the east and Harris Street in the west. \n\nSince 2002, several archaeological investigations have occurred on the sandbank as part of pre-construction legislative requirements. Excavations at sites in George and Charles Streets uncovered more than 10,500 stone artefacts. Axe heads, hammerstones, anvils, grindstone fragments, and cobble chopping tools were recovered from two distinct layers of deposition.\n\nAboriginal life here was likely rich and bountiful. Swamps and waterholes punctuated the sand terrace attracting fish, waterfowl and game, and the grassland was densely vegetated with paperbarks and banksias. Archaeologists uncovered a knapping floor, a place where stone tools were hewn, and numerous cooking hearths and ground ovens. \n\nDerived from the Darug word Burramatta, ‘the place where the eels lie down’, Parramatta was the second area in Australia settled by Europeans. The bulk of early colonial development was clustered along George Street adjacent to the original Queens Wharf. \n\nWithin this area is Robin Thomas Reserve where archaeological investigation revealed a covered drain and sandstock brick footing associated with the c1790 Military Barracks and Soldiers Garden. The convict-built barracks were built within months of colonial possession of Parramatta, but by 1829 were demolished and the soldiers relocated to the newly built Lancers Barracks in Smith Street. \n\nDespite continual adaption and reuse of the barracks site including construction of a nursery, a row of seven terraces, a shop and the stone Somerset Cottage, the sandbank conservation zone within the reserve retains potential to reveal relics and physical evidence of a convict-period military barracks and information about the lives of successive occupants.\n	“Derived from the Darug word Burramatta, ‘the place where the eels lie down’, Parramatta was the second area in Australia settled by Europeans.”	\N	\N
4	Hollywood and Hauntings at the Roxy	On the eve of the Great Depression, the art deco splendour of the Roxy Theatre brought glamour and celebrity to Parramatta. From its dazzling grand opening in 1930, through its various incarnations as an entertainment venue, to its eventual closure in 2015, the Roxy Theatre maintains its atmosphere of high drama and illusionism. It is said to be haunted and has become a magnet for modern-day\nghost busters.	The gala opening on February 6,1930 was widely reported to be a stellar success. Over 8000 people thronged to the venue where guests marvelled at the lavish interior, plush seats, guilt décor, potted palms, rising organ console, and remarkably modern air-conditioning. \n\nA major attraction in the new theatre was the grand Christie organ that had been imported from England at a cost of $32,000. The largest organ in Australia, it was proudly played by organist Eddie Horton, who encouraged the audience to call out or whistle their musical requests.\n\nThe film chosen to open the cinema was a modern classic, the *Innocents of Paris*, (1929), and featured the debonair and hugely popular Frenchman, Maurice Chevalier, in his first Hollywood film.\n\n*Innocents of Paris* includes the famous song Louise sung by Chevalier in his heavy French accent. In fact, Chevalier could speak English without the accent but was urged by the studio to exaggerate his seductive brogue, supposedly causing women and girls the world over to swoon.\n\nThe song *Louise* begins with the words,\n*‘Wonderful, oh, it's wonderful\nTo be in love with you\nBeautiful, you're so beautiful\nYou haunt me all day through’*\n\nHow prescient this last line of the verse proved to be! Since 1937 there have been rumours of ghosts haunting the halls, lofts and basement of the Roxy Theatre. These tormented souls may well be the spirits of those unfortunate individuals who met with tragedy or misfortune at the theatre: the heartbroken usherette who threw herself from the roof; the young boxer who was electrocuted only hours before his fight; an unlucky patron who fell, cracked his skull and died during a performance; or the poor young girl who fell over the first floor balcony, plunging to her death after a panicked crowd tried to escape a fire.\n	“Wonderful, oh, it’s wonderful To be in love with you\nBeautiful, you’re so beautiful\nYou haunt me all day through.”	1930-01-01	\N
5	For a Dentist… Billy Makes a Great Pilot!	In November 1911, William Hart, a Parramatta native, landed his Bristol Box Kite aircraft in Parramatta Park.  The memorial, erected after his death in 1943, commemorates the first cross-country flight in NSW from Penrith covering the distance of 18 miles in 12 minutes. The memorial honours the contributions that the trained dentist Hart, nicknamed the ‘Flying Dentist,’ made to aviation in Australia. \n	William Ewart ‘Billy’ Hart, was not only the first man to fly cross-country when he landed his plane in Parramatta Park back in 1911, he was also the first Australian to hold a Pilot Licence and also the first Australian to crash a plane! \n\nIn the lead up to this historic flight from Penrith, Hart had purchased the Box Kite aircraft from Joseph Hammond who was touring Australia as a demonstration pilot. Hart received a few lessons from Hammond’s mechanic and it appears that he didn’t actually attain a licence until after the event, in December.\n\nHart, who apart from a couple of rudimentary lessons, was a self-taught pilot.  He purportedly crashed almost weekly in preparing for his cross-country flights.  Little is written about Hart’s wife, Thelma Clare, but she must have been nearly as courageous as her husband.\n\nCertainly, it seems the Hart’s were a plucky bunch.  It was Billy’s brother Jack, who accompanied him on that first flight, on that bright November morning, when the biplane, fitted with a beating 37-horsepower engine, soared 3,000 feet towards the clouds.\n\nThe seat was placed at the front of the plane, so there was no protection from the weather and the fabric wings were covered in sago, a starch used in puddings, which tightened the material as it dried.  Jack was reportedly so terrified by the experience that he never flew again.\n \nAll that remains today of Hart’s historic achievements is an inscription on a stone memorial placed in a park. For our tech-savvy, frequent-flying generation, it’s difficult to imagine the sheer ingenuity, skill and nerve to accomplish such pioneering triumphs.  \n\nSo why not make a sago pudding, pack up a picnic and head to Hart’s Memorial, where you can lay back and look up at the sky and imagine Billy flying overhead.  If you listen carefully, you may even hear him calling ‘Here’s for Parramatta.’\n	“For our tech-savvy, frequent-flying generation, it’s difficult to imagine the sheer ingenuity, skill and nerve to accomplish such pioneering triumphs.”	1943-01-01	\N
6	Much More Than Merino Wool	So much of history has been configured with men in the centre of the frame. But neither Elizabeth Farm nor husband John’s reputation as the father of the Australian Merino wool industry would have existed without Elizabeth Macarthur’s determination and dedication to the cause.\n	From the moment the Macarthurs were awarded the generous land grant of 100 acres in 1793, Elizabeth was determined to make it their home. Construction of the single storey home commenced the same year and progressively grew to include servants quarters, guest accommodation, nearby Hambledon Cottage (link) and necessary outhouses, stores and stables. \n\nBy all accounts, John Macarthur was a mercurial man. Ambitious, tenacious and enthusiastic; Macarthur helped topple a governor, was court-martialed and exiled, and considered a dangerous adversary by many. Despite this, Elizabeth Farm was the scene of political and social activity including visits from governors and their wives as well as military and religious leaders. Elizabeth extended hospitality to all, raised and educated her eight children and managed the family’s other properties, including the selection and breeding of their merino sheep.\n\nTaking special interest food production and in her garden, she wrote of its yield: “We have an abundance, even to profusion, in so much that our pigs are fed peaches, apricots and melons in the season.”\n\nIn the garden are two olive trees, thought to be the first grown in Australia. John Macarthur brought specimens of the European Olive to Sydney in 1805 and 1817. He also imported grape vines and advocated strongly for both crops’ commercial production. \n\nWhile much of the hard work around the house and garden was done by an unlimited supply of convict labour, it is with some surprise to learn that the Macarthurs also took advantage of the horticultural expertise of several Greek pirates. Convicted for boarding a British-owned Maltese ship and ‘helping themselves’ to supplies, the pirates had been banished to the antipodes and in 1831 were seen by Captain Thomas Mitchell tending to the vines in the Macarthurs’ garden. \n\nElizabeth outlived her husband and remained at her beloved home until her death in 1850, aged 83. In 1881, when the estate was sold, it encompassed nearly 1100 acres. In 1904, the Swann family bought it and remained owners and residents until 1968.\n\nToday, Elizabeth Farm is operated as a house museum by the Historic Houses Trust of NSW and offers a hands-on experience. Decorated with replica furniture—chairs are for sitting in, and cupboards are for opening—it’s a place where Elizabeth Macarthur’s life and ambitions are given new life. \n	“We have an abundance, even to profusion, in so much that our pigs are fed peaches, apricots and melons in the season.”	1793-01-01	\N
7	The House That Hodges Built	Said to be oldest existing example of an early colonial two-storey townhouse, this gracious Georgian building betrays nothing of her less than dignified past with her connections to gambling, drinking and petty crime. However, a long association with the medical profession has fully restored her dignity.\n	\nBrislington was built for the ex-convict and publican, John Hodges, between 1819 and 1821. A “colourful identity”, Hodges arrived in the colony as a convict. He made a valiant effort to escape the penal settlement by sea but was recaptured in the Timor Sea, transferred to another ship and returned to Port Jackson. Having served his time he received his full pardon in 1814.\n \nHodges had been selling sly grog in the colony. A gambler, Hodges’ luck changed for the better one evening when he won £1000 in gold in a card game at the Woolpack Inn. His winning card had been the eight of Diamonds. Now with financial backing, Hodges sought permission to build his own legitimate inn. The townhouse was constructed as a condition of Hodges’ application to Governor Macquarie for a Liquor License. \n\nTo commemorate his extraordinary good fortune and his winning card, Hodges had the convict labourers incorporate a diamond pattern into the rear wall of the house in darker brick. The house is thought to have been used as the Anchor & Hope Inn.\n\nUnfortunately, Hodges luck changed again when he was found guilty of stealing a large stone from the Government Quarry to build his kitchen fireplace. His conviction obliged him to sell his home and he placed a forced sale advertisement in the Sydney Gazette on 14 April 1825, stating, \n \t\n“The house is newly built...eligible for business...and secured by a perpetual grant”\n\n\nHaving had various owners, the house was purchased by Dr. Walter Brown in 1857. Brown named the home “Brislington” after his hometown in Bristol, England. Three generations of Doctors Brown resided and practiced medicine from the property until 1952.\n\n\nSince the 1850s it has been associated with the medical profession serving as a doctors residence, medical practice, as part of the Parramatta District Hospital, a nurses home and today as The Medical and Nursing Museum.	“The house is newly built...eligible for business...and secured by a perpetual grant”	1819-01-01	1821-01-01
8	Unwrapping the Boer War Memorial	The opening remarks at the unveiling of the Boer War Memorial referred to the strong opposition shown by ‘a certain section of political representatives,’ when the Lancers volunteered to take part in the Boer War. The memorial , a miscellany of recycled columns from the 1837 Courthouse, topped by an 1856 field gun and flanked by 2 cannons, is replete, not only with architectural layers but also social and cultural significance demanding to be unwrapped.\n	In the early twentieth century monuments were the site of shared national values and ideals which commemorated courage, patriotism and the sacrifice of war, and the erection of the Boer War Memorial at Parramatta Park, in 1904, supported this sentiment.\n\nThe memorial itself is not without symbolism. The war action was seemingly well supported in Parramatta and the grand and stately pillars of the old courthouse represented their support of the empire and the broken column stood for the ten lives broken short.\n\nThe Boer War was the first overseas military engagement in which troops representing Australia, as distinct from Britain, took part. Consequently, it is no surprise that the memorial which commemorated the actions of these troops to join the fight with the British Empire against other colonists in South Africa saw some opposition at its unveiling.\n\nDespite this opposition, largely from the anti-war leagues, protesting against the reported starvation and death in concentration camps, Australians generally supported the war. But perhaps not necessarily as a devout display of loyalism but as a means of feeding their families, as enlistment offered steady pay and work.  At the outset of the Boer War in 1899 Australia was emerging from the depression of the early 1890’s which saw the collapse of many banks. \n\nThe memorial was designed by Sir John Sulman, who was also one of the first officers to enrol in the Lancers from Parramatta despite being over the ‘prescribed age.’  Incredibly, \nSulman who was also known as the ‘Father of town planning,’ has a medal named in his honour, which is today seen as a key factor in establishing the careers of young Australian Architects.\n\nThe Boer War Memorial can be interpreted in so many ways, spend an afternoon in its company, and see what it opens up for you. \n	"At the outset of the Boer War in 1899 Australia was emerging from the depression of the early 1890’s."	1904-01-01	\N
11	‘How Much?’ Gross Overcharging in Colonial Architecture. 	The Bath House was designed by Colonial Architect Standish Harris in 1822, and constructed a year later for Governor Brisbane. A year after its completion, the architect responsible for the elaborate heated plunge pool, domed roof and cupola lantern, was out of a job! Harris’s claim for fees and ‘gross overcharges’, considered excessive by Chief Engineer Ovens and Governor Brisbane meant Harris’ services as an architect were ‘no longer useful.’ \n	Standish Lawrence Harris arrived in Sydney in 1822, a free settler. In the same year he was appointed as the Civil Architect to replace Francis Greenway. He was permitted a 10 per cent commission on the value of works for which he was to be engaged, plus a salary of 100 pounds per annum. \n\nHis chief project, during his brief appointment was the construction of the grand Bath House designed to imitate the Roman Baths found in England. When built, the Bath House had three entranceways, leading to an outer corridor from which views to the outside could be seen through glassed windows. \n\nFor its time, the Bath House was sophisticated, with water pumped to the Bath House through lead pipes from the nearby Parramatta River, and then down to a duck pond below. Evidently, Harris felt that the complexity of a heated plunge pool with Roman mausoleum styling and ornamental cornice warranted a reasonable compensation. Standish deemed it ‘a most commodious and useful appendage to the Government House at Parramatta.’\n\nWhist there is no actual evidence in relation to any direct criticism of the Bath House, Harris’s report and expose on the public buildings of NSW, requested by the Governor, was not well received. The report, apart from being highly critical of his predecessor Greenway’s work, was also delivered with a sizeable claim for fees.\n\nBoth Brisbane and Ovens, the Chief Engineer decided that Harris was as uncooperative as his forerunner Greenway.  Apparently neither man appreciated his views on fair rewards for convicts, and came to see him as greedy and no longer of use, he was promptly dismissed.  \n\nWho knows what happened to Harris, it seems as though he sold his land and property in the Hunter region in 1831 to clear debts, and in 1846 he was still petitioning government for a large sum of money.\n\nToday the Bath House is a shaded summer house, where you can rest up and perhaps muse over what Harris’s fate...\n	"Standish deemed it ‘a most commodious and useful appendage to the Government House at Parramatta."	1822-01-01	1823-01-01
12	Cultural Clashes and Comets!	Today, very little remain of Governor Brisbane’s observatory, except for two stone piers, which once supported the transit telescope. Whilst the piers are all that remains of the southern hemisphere’s early astronomical observations, their existence takes us back to the lives of the early astronomers. The stones lead us back to the lives of Dunlop and Rumker and the workplace politics and power play that beset, even nineteenth century employees! \n\n	\n The study of the heavens was considered as an intellectual enterprise of the greatest prestige. At the outset of settlement in Australia the name of the game was sheer survival and gazing at the southern skies and stars was seen as the domain of the privileged and wealthy.  As astronomy began to be recognised as serving a practical function such as meteorology and time-keeping, men of means such as Governor Thomas Brisbane, began establishing observatories.\n\nBrisbane enlisted the help of James Dunlop and Carl Rumker who accompanied him to NSW.  The team of astronomers worked together to calculate and prepare for the appearance of Encke’s Comet in June 1822, a star that could not be seen in Europe.  \n\nAlmost a year later Rumker suddenly left the observatory.  The story goes that as Brisbane and Dunlop both came from Scotland they had a common culture which meant Dunlop was favoured.  Even though Rumker, who was from Germany, was initially praised and financially rewarded for his observation of Encke’s Comet he felt excluded by the pair. \n\nRumker is also believed to have clashed with Brisbane, because he saw himself the professional peer of Brisbane. They are believed to have fallen out as they could not compromise or agree professionally or personally on calculations, who should be credited for the scientific work, or Brisbane’s love of shooting!  \n\nApparently the relationship between Dunlop and Rumker was also strained after Rumker was given a gift of land for recovering the comet.  All the while Governor Brisbane was criticised by the Sydney community for his preoccupation with celestial events rather than addressing the problems of the colony!\n\nVisit the ‘Transit Stones’ to learn, how even in the face of great scientific discovery, the site of the Observatory was not without its problems.\n	"Governor Brisbane was criticised by the Sydney community for his preoccupation with celestial events rather than addressing the problems of the colony."	1821-01-01	1822-01-01
9	Was Dairy Cottage Actually a Dairy?	History is written and re-written every day.  New evidence is found, existing records reveal many and varied interpretations and there is always the opportunity for new discoveries. This certainly seems to be the case for the Dairy Cottage whose current interpretation is under debate.  Recent research certainly adds a new layer to the current history of the Dairy Cottage, but in no way diminishes the rich tapestry of this important place. \n	According to heritage consultant Sue Rosen’s theories put forward in her book on Government House, it is quite probable that the building that is currently represented as the Dairy Cottage in the Dairy Precinct may have actually been the Garden Precinct.\n\nRosen provides a rich and complex layering of the site, but most interesting is her theory that the Dairy was in actual fact located not on the Parramatta River as currently represented, but near the Domain Creek.  \n\nThe inquest into the death of a stockman John Holland provides fascinating evidence into the basis of her argument. In December 1817 stockmen John Holland and Edward Knight went to ‘bathe in the creek near the Government Dairy.’ Holland got out of his depth in a water hole and drowned.  The assistant surgeon testified that Holland’s body was found ‘near the Government Dairy at Parramatta.’ \n\nState Records show that Knight, who was with Holland, went to look for help at the mill and from the Government Gardener, John England, whose testimony also included the word ‘creek.’ The mill referred to in the records was located on the Domain Creek.  The river did not rate a mention in the inquest which indicates that the dairy was located near the Domain Creek rather than the Parramatta River.\n\nThis analysis of evidence suggests that the dairy was located adjacent to the Domain Creek and that it has not survived. It is quite possible that the area now identified as the ‘Dairy Precinct’ was a garden and orchard area and that the house known as ‘Dairy Cottage’ was indeed the gardener’s house, constructed in 1814 with material recycled from the 1790’s!\n\nTo confuse matters further, a dairy was constructed in the gardeners’ house in 1823.  The architectural description resembles the sunken room located in the Ranger’s Cottage which is located next to the Dairy Cottage.\n\nHead on up to the Park and see if you can figure it out...\n\n	"It is quite possible that the area now identified as the ‘Dairy Precinct’ was a garden and orchard area and that the house known as ‘Dairy Cottage’ was indeed the gardener’s house."	1797-01-01	1816-01-01
10	A Second Bridge for Parramatta 	It’s hard to imagine a world without bridges—so often it is that we need to span rivers, traverse ravines and straddle difficult terrain. The 1885 Gasworks Bridge provided a long-awaited second crossing of Parramatta River, connecting the thriving city with the northern suburbs and beyond.\n	Called the Gasworks Bridge because of its proximity to the coal-fired gas factory—the city's well-loved 19th-century symbol of modernity. The Gasworks had been lighting the streets, shops, churches and public buildings of Parramatta since 1873, and along with other important industries was positioned by the river for easy access to coal-laden barges. \n\nEast and west of the Gasworks, mills for flour and wool were operating, and the riverfront was busy with boatsheds and inns supporting the fledgling industrial estates. Despite this, getting across the river remained difficult.\n\nBut bridge building was not to be taken lightly. From the colonial days, the need to conquer Australia's unpredictable waterways had been a constant challenge. Sandstone bridges, though popular, were slow to build, and a better solution had long been sought. \n\nJohn A McDonald, the Department of Public Works Bridge Engineer, had championed a timber-trussed bridge that had systematically been rolled out in regional towns where they could be constructed quickly from selected local timbers. He pioneered the testing of timbers to determine their strength for the purpose using a machine called the Greenwood and Batley Testing Machine located at the Sydney University School of Civil Engineering.  \n\nBut the crossing of the river at the Gasworks required a much longer span than the timber-truss bridge could offer. It demanded a more prodigious solution; one that would accommodate the future, and heavier road loads. It needed to satisfy increasing public demand for a bridge and supplement Lennox Bridge located further upstream at Church Street.\n\nThe Gasworks Bridge, also known as Newlands Bridge after the Gasworks’ engineer, John Newlands Wark, is one of 32 iron-lattice bridges built between 1870 and 1893 across the state. It has three 31-metre sections, spanning 110 metres in total. \n\nDesigned by John McDonald and his Public Works colleagues, the bridge was custom-made in England and shipped to Australia. The wrought iron components were rolled and formed into bars and strips. These pieces were welded together to create the iron-lattice trusses characteristic of its type. Arriving from England in sections, the components were bolted and welded and mounted on the buttressed sandstone piers. Relatively speedy to build, iron-lattice bridges cost approximately $9000 per metre compared to the $1500 per metre timber-truss system.\n\nWhile the Gasworks Bridge remains, the factory has long gone. However, remnants of its foundations and a number of wooden pier footings can be seen in Queens Wharf Reserve. Several commemorative sandstone blocks from the factory site are on public display at the Parramatta Heritage and Visitors Centre.\n	"Designed by John McDonald and his Public Works colleagues, the bridge was custom-made in England and shipped to Australia."	1885-01-01	\N
16	The Strange Allure of an Orphanage.	Orphanages are for children without parents, right?\nWrong. In Sydney’s first female orphanage which opened in 1818 in Parramatta, 80% of the girls had one or both parents alive and in the colony.\n	By the early 1800s hundreds of children were in need of government care as poverty and hardship bit hard. The Female Orphan School located beside Parramatta River at Rydalmere, offered destitute mothers, single mothers and widowed fathers a place where their offspring, wanted or unwanted, would be fed, clothed, and taught to read and write. \n\nRecords indicate that parents and guardians were relatively keen to have the state look after their offspring, no doubt recognising their children’s dire futures should the school not welcome them into the fold.\n\nGaining entry to the Female Orphan School wasn’t always easy: demand outweighed supply, so one had to demonstrate a strong case for admittance.\n\nThe applications to the school are telling. In 1829 Elizabeth Griffiths, mother Margaret and Esther, wrote to the Orphanage Council stating: “That the father of these two children is now in Sydney jail under the awful sentence of death and your petitioner is a poor woman and not in a condition to provide maintenance and proper education for the above mentioned children.”\n\nOne Peter Cooke writes: “that John Lewis has two children now under his charge, a girl aged 10 and a boy aged six years to provide for, but which are principally supported by the voluntary donation of charitable people, their mother Mary Lewis died a few days after childbirth. John Lewis aged 75 has reared the child by hand-feeding since the mothers death in June 1831.” Cooke, whose relationship to the Lewis family is unknown, requested that young Charlotte be admitted to the school where she no doubt cried for want of love and comfort, and the lack of her brother’s company. \n\nWhile getting within the gates of the orphanage may have been hard, getting out again was even harder. Applications in writing were required along with evidence of the ability to provide for, educate and protect the child from moral danger. \n\nNot all children enrolled in the school went there voluntarily. Women from the Female Factory had their children placed in the orphan school once they were three years old, and in some cases were never reunited with their mothers. Aboriginal girls were also enrolled after the closure of the Native Institute.	"While getting within the gates of the orphanage may have been hard, getting out again was even harder."	1813-01-01	1940-01-01
20	Sanity and Shinto Gardening for Good Health	The beautiful Wisteria House Gardens and the grounds of the former Parramatta Hospital for the Insane still flourish with trees and flowering vines planted over one hundred years ago. They are evidence of a very modern approach to health and well-being where it was felt that the “agitation” of the insane may be calmed by eating fresh produce grown on site, spending time in the beautiful surrounds and participating in work and gentle outdoor exercise.\n	Wisteria House, also known as Glengarriff Cottage, was built in 1906-7 and designed by the prodigious Government Architect, Colonel Walter Liberty Vernon, in the “arts and crafts” Federation style. \n\nThe cottage was built as the official residence for the Medical Superintendent, Dr. William Cotter Williamson. Williamson had come to the hospital in 1883 as an Assistant Medical Superintendent. During the 1880s he was instrumental in the redesigning of the grounds and the landscaping of the site of the former “female factory”.\n\nWilliamson believed that the patients would benefit enormously from the gardens and that that they should be an integral part of effective patient care and therapy. To build the gardens, Williamson engaged the more able bodied patients, commenting that they were privileged to work but never forced to do it.\n\nIn 1907, Williamson accompanied his daughters, Nora and Nightingale, on a musical tour of Japan. Nora became a highly accomplished violinist, touring the world to great acclaim. Indeed, Williamson appreciated the positive effects of music and diversions for his patients, organizing concerts and picnics to alleviate “the gloom which is a natural concomitant of ...chronic insanity”.\n\nThe wisteria after which the Gardens are named (originally “wistaria”) was propagated from cuttings that Dr. Williamson brought back from this visit to \nJapan. The Gardens were initially designed as a “Romantic arcadia”, a kind of idyllic, harmonious space. Another Japanese element was added to the gardens in the Tori (sic) gate folly.  A torii gate typically stands at the entrance of a Shinto shrine and represents the division between the physical and spiritual realms. Perhaps Williamson hoped that his gardens might offer a similarly otherworldly experience of calm and serenity.\n\nSince 1929 the Wisteria Gardens, that include the original surviving wisteria vines, prunus trees and English elms, have been opened to the public every September.\n	"To build the gardens, Williamson engaged the more able bodied patients, commenting that they were privileged to work but never forced to do it."	1906-01-01	2001-07-01
30	Lunacy, Mania and Other Types of Madness	It comes as a surprise that colonial Sydney in its bright sunny land, far from the troubles of English cities, wet with cold and poverty-stricken, is reported to have had high levels of mental illness. The first legislation addressing ‘lunacy’ was enacted in 1843 and made provisions for the criminal or dangerously insane to be confined to a gaol or public hospital.\n	\nFree settlers and ex-convicts alike were seen as susceptible to "bush madness", "moral insanity", "sunstroke", “melancholia” and "delirium tremens", the latter being due to binge drinking and adulterated alcohol. "Gold mania” was also reported after the discovery of gold in the mid 1850s and in general, a fear of madness ruled the day.\n\nIn many ways though, the experience of Australia’s new population mimicked the rise of mental illnesses in industrialised parts of Europe. Overcrowding, poverty, oppressive work practices and loss of family connection as factories in large cities replaced small close-knit villages, set the scene. Banishment to Australia was far more than physical punishment; for many it presented acute mental and emotional turmoil. \n\nExacerbated by the lack of understanding of cause and treatment of psychiatric conditions, and combined with the brutal and punitive approaches aimed at ‘curing’ the various disorders, the reputation of asylums as madhouses may have been apt.\n\nRydalmere Hospital for the Insane was proclaimed in May 1888 as a branch of Parramatta Hospital for the Insane, and joined the list of several facilities already in operation.\n\nInitially, Rydalmere catered for those with chronic cases while the mothership, Parramatta Asylum dealt with the criminal and dangerously insane. De rigueur at Rydalmere, as with other hospitals of the day, were substandard conditions and treatments, with violence and assault, both sexual and physical a regular occurrence.\n\nSome 17 per cent of deaths at the asylum were due to ‘maniacal exhaustion’. Today this may be attributed to the withdrawal of alcohol during which the patient experiences seizures, fevers, and hallucinations and when left untreated can cause death. \n\nMurders and suicides were not uncommon: 23 year old Cecil Crouch was strangled by an inmate in 1928 allegedly in response to him being ‘unsettled’ or distressed. The perpetrator then attempted to commit suicide.\n\nRydalmere was one of the first institutions to use Electrotherapy, the predecessor of today’s Electroconvulsive therapy.	"Initially, Rydalmere catered for those with chronic cases while the mothership, Parramatta Asylum dealt with the criminal and dangerously insane."	1813-01-01	1940-01-01
31	The Marsden Family Zeal	The Reverend Samuel Marsden was a driving force behind the establishment of the Parramatta Female Orphan School. Opposing the ‘boarding out’ policy used to manage orphaned children in the colony, he argued with his characteristic evangelical zeal that institutional care was needed to raise the street urchins with proper “principles of morality and industry.” \n	\nThus, the Orphan School that relied on non-orphans as their primary clients was born. Many fingers may have been in the pie—Governor King funded it, Governor Macquarie laid the foundation stone, and Mrs. Macquarie chose the building’s design—but it was Marsden who oversaw the operation of the orphanage. \n\nMore partial to the orphans than he was to the women convicts at the Female Factory, whose needs he was said to ignore, Marsden wrote enthusiastically about the construction of the school, calling it “a noble building.”\n\nOpening in 1818, it replaced an existing orphan school in George Street Sydney and over time the orphanage population grew. In 1821, 60 girls aged between three and 13 were enrolled, but by 1834 over 170 were accommodated. When Macquarie’s Native Institution closed in 1826, the remaining Aboriginal girls were enrolled in the Orphan School.\n\nReligious instruction was a core focus, and along with reading and writing, the girls learnt to cook, sew and were trained in the basics of domestic work. Once they reached the age of 13, they were placed into service as household servants, despite widespread belief that many turned to prostitution.\n\nAmidst growing concerns about the condition of the boy’s orphanage in Liverpool, in 1850, the two homes amalgamated to become the Protestant Orphan School. About the same time and as a result of the official sanction of Catholicism in the colony, the Roman Catholic Orphan School opens upstream at the Female Factory allowing for different ministrations.\n\nAt this point another of the Marsden family is ushered in to rule the roost at the Protestant Orphan School; the youngest daughter of Samuel Marsden, Martha Betts. The longest serving Matron of the school, according to reports in the Richmond and Windsor Gazette, she was well equipped for the task having five children of her own, in addition to “splendid management, education, and accomplishments.” \n\nThere is no record of Martha’s exact qualifications to take on the job, or her performance in the position, but it serves as another example of the nepotism rife within the circles of colonial elite. Betts paid herself well, receiving nearly 12 pounds per month (approximately $1500.\n\nMartha’s husband Josiah Betts was Master of the School until his death in 1863, a position then awarded to their son Edward. He too, was well renumerated. 	"Once they reached the age of 13, they were placed into service as household servants, despite widespread belief that many turned to prostitution."	1813-01-01	1940-01-01
39	If it looks like a duck...	Flowerdale Lagoon is billabong located on the outskirts of Wagga Wagga, within Wiradjuri country. It forms part of the Murrumbidgee River and wetlands system and is also included in the Wiradjuri Walking Track, which winds around the city of Wagga Wagga, following the curves of the Murrumbidgee River. Flowerdale Lagoon is the source of the city name, Wagga Wagga.\n	The original, indigenous inhabitants of the area are the Wiradjuri people who today, make up the largest Aboriginal group in New South Wales. The name ‘Wagga Wagga’ is derived from the Wiradjuri language meaning ‘place of many crows’ and it was at the Western end of the lagoon where the crows gathered. Other translations for the name include that promoted by Wiradjuri man Stan Grant, which suggests the term describes sacred ceremonies in which a man dances in circles with a rolling, grinding gait. Others suggest that ‘wagga’ refers to the reeling of a sick or dizzy man.\n\nThe river systems have always been of central importance to the Wiradjuri people and their country was known as the ‘land of three rivers’: the Wambool (Macquarie), the Kalare (Lachlan) and the Murrumbidjeri (Murrumbidgee). The Murray River forms the Wiradjuri southern border.\n\nThe Wiradjuri people continue to have a strong presence in Wagga Wagga today and Flowerdale Lagoon is the site of important cultural practices and historical significance. Before white settlement, the indigenous peoples fished the rivers for Murray cod, perch, mussels and yabbies. They also feasted on the wildfowl, which lived in the dense reeds on the shore. In the summer months they would travel to the Alpine areas to catch the Bogong moths to eat.\n\nThe lagoon area is blessed with an abundance of bird life, including ducks, wrens, Rufous Songlarks and the Sacred Kingfisher. Platypus too may be found in the Murrumbidgee River system and the Wiradjuri Creation story of Biladurang explains how the shy platypus came to be. \n\nOne day, an adventurous young duck named Gaygar was swimming on the Narran Lake with her friends. She ignored the warnings of the old people to take care and was soon captured by the river rat known as Bigoon. Months later she escaped from Bigoon and returned to the lake for the nesting season. When her own eggs hatched she was shocked and frightened to show them to the other ducks. Like the river rat, her babies had short thick fur and four legs instead of two but they also had a duck’s bill, webbed feet and a large, flat tail. The old people banished her and her babies from the lake for disrespecting their advice and fearing that her offspring would bring bad luck.\n\nGaygar left the lake and swam far away, through the streams and rivers, looking for a waterhole where her babies would be safe. As she travelled further south the water became colder and colder and eventually she became weak and died. Her babies however thrived in these cooler waters and stayed in the south to produce shy, furry babies of their own.	"Platypus too may be found in the Murrumbidgee River system and the Wiradjuri Creation story of Biladurang explains how the shy platypus came to be."	\N	\N
42	The Big water = many fish equation	The Murrumbidgee rises in the foothills of the Snowy Mountains and flows west for about 1500 kilometres where it meets the Murray before turning south towards the sea in South Australia. The name Murrumbidgee means ‘big water’ in the Wiradjuri language, the Indigenous people of the region.	Along with ‘big water’ comes big fish. According to past accounts, the river was alive with multiple species including Murray Cod, Yellow Belly (Golden Perch), Catfish, Blackfish and Trout Cod. There were also platypus, crayfish, yabbies and mussels, and abundant waterbird life. \n\nBefore white man arrived, the Wiradjuri navigated the far reaches of the Murrumbidgee in bark canoes and ranged the river banks on foot. They fished the river with ingenuity.\n\nLong fishing nets made of woven possum hair or fibres from the Kurrajong tree were stretched across small creeks to entangle fish. Aboriginal people also ‘strained’ sections of the river; men on opposite sides of the river each with an end of the net would walk along slowly. Reports indicate this could capture between 130-180 kilograms of fish. \n\nOther hunting methods also employed nets. By climbing trees on each side of the river, young men would suspend long nets 1.8 metres high across it. Someone else would scare nearby nesting ducks into flight, steering them into the nets for capture by throwing bark decoys.\n\nWooden spears of 1.5 metres in length with barbed points were used lance-like to spear fish from canoes. \n\nFish traps were sophisticated. Systems of rock weirs and races made of logs trapped large fish in specific sections of the river while allowing smaller ones to swim free. \n\nThe Wiradjuri were known to restock fish numbers in lagoons and ponds when they were low by scooping fish fry into coolamons and carrying them to where they were needed. During floods they dammed the creeks with fallen trees to provide refuge for smaller fish from the fast flowing water, preventing them from being washed away. After floods, they rescued stranded fish replacing them into waterholes or lagoons.\n\nToday, however, the fish populations of the Murrumbidgee are reported to be 10% of what they were before white settlement. Tree clearing, agricultural runoff causing increased sedimentation has altered the river environment so that the preferred rocky and woody habitats of native fish are few and far between.\n\nIntroduced species have thrived and now compete with native species.\n\nSadly, the equation Big water = many fish should be rewritten to Big water + white man = almost no fish.

13	First Stumbling Blocks for Irish Australia	Catholicism in Australia had a shaky start. Just as the English were setting up shop in Sydney, they were struggling to control uprisings in other colonised lands. The 1798 Battle of Vinegar Hill in Ireland, a particularly bloody rebellion, was fought out between Irish rebels and 15,000 English soldiers. In its aftermath, more than 400 Catholic and passionately Irish rebels involved in the Battle were transported to NSW. \n	Things in Sydney and Parramatta were already tense. Food shortages threatened. Building was proving a hard slog. And converting the heathens to Anglicanism was not going well; in preference the convicts had turned to rabble-rousing with rum. So in a moment of conciliation towards the colony’s already restless Catholic population, Governor King allowed Father James Dixon—himself one of the transported rebels—to conduct the first Mass in Parramatta in 1803.\n\nIt was a decision soon regretted. Far from being appeased by the Governor’s concession, the Irish continued their political campaign against the British. They banded together and in 1804 mounted a copy-cat Vinegar Hill rebellion in Castle Hill. Nearly 300 Irish convicts gathered on the outskirts of Parramatta with a bold plan to seize control of Sydney and Parramatta, determined to return to Ireland and continue the fight against British injustices. \n\nShouting “Death or Liberty” the convicts outnumbered the Redcoats 10:1. Their leader Philip Cunningham met with Major Johnson, who suggested bringing in Father Dixon to calm things down. Cunningham retorted "Death or Liberty, and a ship to take us home" and was promptly shot. The rebels bolted and after a long night eventually rounded up and harshly punished.\n\nThe home-grown Battle of Vinegar Hill became one of the several reasons not to condone Mass nor authorise the construction of Catholic churches until the 1820s when the first official Catholic Chaplains arrived in the colony.\n\nSo it wasn’t until 1836 that the foundation stone for St Patrick’s was finally laid down providing a bona fide place of Catholic worship in Parramatta. The Church, located across the river from the Anglican St John’s and close to the Female Factory , was said to be a smaller version of St Mary’s in Sydney.\n\nOnce mover and shaker Bishop Bede Polding arrived in Sydney, things finally got on a roll and in a short time 13 Catholic primary schools were in operation, all with government support. 1854 saw the old church replaced, and later in 1904 the presbytery, Murphys House, named after assistant priest Father Peter Murphy, was built. \n\nToday, St Patrick's is both a modern Cathedral occupying its original 1820s site and a reminder of Irish struggles for independence here and abroad.\n	"Cunningham retorted "Death or Liberty, and a ship to take us home" and was promptly shot. The rebels bolted and after a long night eventually rounded up and harshly punished."	1824-01-01	1972-01-01
23	House and Garden on the Hill	Named by the second occupant of the property, Penelope Lucas, former governess to John Macarthur’s daughters, Hambledon Cottage is more than the residence of an ageing nanny. 	Located on relatively high ground, to the rear of the Parramatta sandbank on the richest of relatively poor soil, the property was originally part of the 100-acre land grant made to John Macarthur in 1793. Nestled on the hill between Experiment Farm to the west and Elizabeth Farm to the east, Hambledon Cottage was built between 1821 and 1824 to provide additional accommodation for Elizabeth Farm.\n\nMany colonials prized the high ground: it attracted cooling breezes, provided views, and was unlikely to flood. Land grants like these on prime real estate have earned the title of 'the dress circle' as they enabled the Parramatta elite—the nation’s early pastoralists and entrepreneurs—to securely build colonial enterprises and amass personal wealth. \n\nThe original cottage was designed by would-be-colonial architect Henry Kitchen, who arrived in Sydney in 1816 to find himself forever playing second fiddle to convict architect Francis Greenway. Before an untimely death, Kitchen found favour with Macarthur and was employed on several of his building projects, including Elizabeth Farm and Camden Park. \n\nBuilt of rendered sandstock brick in Colonial Georgian style, the joinery is of Australian cedar and is an excellent example of fine Georgian detailing. Some of the internal ceilings and walls are of lath and plaster and one bedroom retains its original ironbark floor. \n\nArchdeacon Thomas Hobbes Scott, a friend of the Macarthur's, was first to reside in the cottage in 1825, building the adjacent coach house and stables in 1826.\n\n1827 saw Scott move out and Penelope Lucas, governess to Elizabeth, Mary and Emmeline Macarthur, move in. Residing there until her death in 1836, a memorial to Lucas commemorating her activities within the church and community is displayed in St. John's Cathedral. \n\nThe enclosed garden is partly attributed to Scott and subsequently Lucas, who were both keen gardeners. Defined by a towering Bunya Pine and featuring Clivia, Wisteria, Nandina, olives, a Spanish Oak tree, the garden design and plantings illustrate the importance of the ‘home and garden package’ to colonial sentiment. Local and exotic specimens feature, along with plants Macarthur brought with him on board the "Lord Eldon" in 1817.\n\nFrom 1839-1847, Dr Matthew Anderson occupied the Cottage while acting as the Macarthur family physician. Anderson had held office as Assistant Colonial Surgeon and Surgeon at Parramatta Hospital and the Female Factory and Orphan School and was close friends with the Macarthurs. \n\nCalled 'Macarthur's Farm', the property was divided in 1883 and bought by Francis John Wickham for 1100 pounds who lived there until he died in 1892. Renaming it ‘Firholme’ he added a new entrance at Hassall Street with stone pillars and wrought iron gates bringing the property into the 20th century.\n\nPassed from owner to owner in the early part of the century, Hambledon Cottage was secured for posterity in 1950 when the Whitehall Pharmaceutical Company donated it and the northern grounds to Parramatta City Council. In 1961, the Council leased it to Parramatta and District Historical Society for use as a house museum. They have recently celebrated the museum’s 50th year of operation.

33	Beware of Imposters	History isn’t always straightforward, and sometimes it can be difficult to know when there’s an imposter in your midst.\n	Take Linden House. Fine Georgian building it most certainly is. And prized home of the Lancers Museum and all things war, Boer, and more.\nBut Linden House’s foundations were in fact laid in Macquarie Street, half a kilometre up the road. \n\nAnd Linden House has a very feminine history.\n\nBuilt in 1828 as a Female School of Industry with funds provided by Mrs Eliza Darling and her hearty fundraising efforts. Eliza Darling was the wife of yet another unpopular NSW Governor, Sir Ralph Darling. By all accounts she was a pious, conservative and evangelical woman, driven to do ‘good works’. \n\nThe privately-run school trained girls as domestic servants and offered a curriculum that ran to ‘reading, writing and the four first rules of arithmetic, every branch of household work, plain needlework, knitting and spinning’.\n\nIndustry Schools were operational across England at the time, and can be seen as partner organisations to the government-sponsored Female Factory and the Female Orphan Home and part of the network of reform and social betterment in its fight against the ‘moral disorder posing a threat to society’.\n\nUntil 1963, Linden House stayed put in Macquarie Street and watched a long line of residents come and go. Bought by the AMP society and given to the Royal New South Wales Lancers Association, the building was dismantled, and stone by stone marched up the road to its current location within the Barracks precinct.\n \nThis action no doubt saved Linden House from likely destruction as Parramatta's new CBD was surging forward onto the main streets of Macquarie and George and there was little room for a two-storey Georgian cottage. It also provided a much-needed repository for the Lancer history. \n\nThis adoption into a military family no doubt saved Linden House from likely destruction as Parramatta's new CBD was surging forward onto the main streets of Macquarie and George and there was little room for a two-storey Georgian cottage. It also provided a much-needed repository for the Lancer history. \n\nBut things are often not what they seem. And just as Linden House in its current location has had its exterior stone redressed and its doors, windows and internal timber features replaced, relocation of historic buildings can obscure early histories and sometimes allows one thing to masquerade as another.	"This adoption into a military family no doubt saved Linden House from likely destruction as Parramatta's new CBD was surging forward onto the main streets of Macquarie and George and there was little room for a two-storey Georgian cottage."	1828-01-01	\N
40	Jaws and more	Stories about sharks have beguiled—and terrified—Australians since time began. Heavily infested with sharks, the waters of Montague Island and Narooma Inlet have spawned their fair share of stories. 	Predating all of them is the Yuin tale that tells of one of their folk who, returning from Montague Island after a successful day’s fishing was pursued by a shark of “unusual size”.  The shark harassed him in his bark canoe, causing him to paddle faster and faster, able only to keep the shark at bay by throwing out his fish one by one until he reached home when “… the last fish was gone”.\n\nThen there’s the tale told by William Williams, who was Headkeeper of Montague Lighthouse from 1916-25. One night, after meeting the supply steamer, Williams and his son Carl were rowing their well-laden boat back to the Island when a shark broke the blade clean off the steering oar throwing Williams to the floor of the boat.\n\nIn the 1930s shark jaws harvested from grey nurse and tiger sharks were sold to tourists, and as early as the 1890s sharks were being caught using hook and steel lines. Mr Ross & Sons fished for sharks commercially and in two seasons (1894-96) caught 600 sharks. Once hooked, a blow to the head stunned the shark before it was brought aboard and its liver and fins removed. The livers were boiled down for oil and sold as a therapeutic product. The fins were dried and sold locally to the Chinese, who ground the dried fin and reconstituted it into soup.\n\nThe sharks, attracted by the thousands of spawning salmon that migrated to the Inlet annually, are said to have made the water swirl “with their wild rushes at the poor little fish”. According to Laurelle Pacey, local historian, numerous reports provide insight into the fishing frenzy that resulted from dolphins, whales and sharks hunting blue and yellowfin tuna, mackerel, and salmon. As a child, John Annis remembers hearing the roar of the fish coming into the Inlet accompanied by dolphins and sharks. "The waters were a seething mass, black with salmon and so thick you could walk on them”.\n\nBut everyone knows sharks like to eat more than just fish.\n\nDissection of a 14ft shark caught with a rope hanging out of its mouth revealed the rope attached to collar and cattle dog, had been consumed whole along with a pair of rubber-soled tennis shoes.\n	 "As a child, John Annis remembers hearing the roar of the fish coming into the Inlet accompanied by dolphins and sharks. "The waters were a seething mass, black with salmon and so thick you could walk on them”.\n	\N	\N
53	Romancing the Stone	The Chinese Drystone wall is an attractive landscape feature of the Tilba area. The wall was constructed using found stones and follows the curve of a hill to form a stock barrier. Although its name evokes the influx of Chinese prospectors associated with the Australian goldfields, it is thought that the wall was actually built by a local man of European heritage.	Drystone walls are built without using any mortar to bind the stones together. Long before European settlement, Aboriginal people built drystone walls for both habitation and in the construction of fish and eel traps. When the Europeans arrived they too built dry stone structures to fence in their stock animals and to create property boundaries.  In mining areas and in sites with steep terrain such as Tilba, the practice was also used to create retaining walls, especially near roads and housing.\n \nThe best view of the Chinese Drystone Wall is to be had from the Tilba Tilba Track, which ascends Gulaga, also known as Mount Dromedary in the Gulaga National Park. This steep narrow track was built in 1894 by the gold miners working the area. The grave of the “Unknown Chinaman” is located on the track, marked by a cairn of stones. It is thought that about 7000 Chinese miners worked the goldfields around Araluen. The Chinese miners used different mining methods to the Europeans and often found gold by going over abandoned sites. When they did dig for gold, they commonly constructed round shafts rather than square or rectangular ones. This was a technique designed to reduce the likelihood of cave-ins and was a way of ensuring that evil spirits could not hide in corners.\n\nThe term ‘Chinese Wall’ refers to those structures built from hand-stacked rock tailings or mining debris. The practice was introduced to Australia and the United States by Chinese immigrants, between the 1860s and 1890s.  \n\nThe Chinese miners worked the creeks, moving the rocks by hand and running water and gravel through sluice boxes to sift out the heavier gold flakes and small nuggets. Mining the streambeds for alluvial gold was called placer mining and the discarded rocks were stacked into walls. In Granite, Oregon, USA, the Chinese Walls, also known as the Ah Hee Diggings, measure up to 15 feet wide and 12 feet high.\n\nIt is thought that the Chinese Drystone wall was actually constructed by Harry Greatorex, a man of European descent who was also drawn to the area for its goldfields. Mr Greatorex became renowned in the Tilba area as a gardener, regularly winning first prize at local agricultural shows for his splendid fruit and vegetable produce grown in his market gardens. In 1916 the Cobargo Chronicle was tickled to report that Mr Greatorex had sent to the editor a “monster watermelon” that had prompted a guessing competition as to its weight. The editor himself won the competition being closest to the exact weight of 22 pounds.\n	"The Chinese miners worked the creeks, moving the rocks by hand and running water and gravel through sluice boxes to sift out the heavier gold flakes and small nuggets."	\N	\N
65	The Chinese opium dens	\nIn the 1870s and 1880s at the lower end of Fitzmaurice Street, not far from where Wiradjuri Bridge now straddles the Murrumbidgee River, a Chinese camp thrived.\n	As eager immigrants, the Chinese had arrived during the Gold Rushes of the 1850s. Moving south from the NSW goldfields, by 1883, there were 223 Chinese living in Wagga Wagga representing 5% of town’s population.\n\nDespite their relatively small numbers—194 men, seven women presumably married to Chinese men, 16 children and seven prostitutes—they made their presence known.\n\nAnd that’s because they brought with them two significant distractions: opium and gambling.\n\nIt’s hard to believe today that until 1906 opium was perfectly legal. Frowned upon, yes, but illegal, no. Reports indicate that about 27% of Chinese men were regular smokers of opium by the 1900s, so it was no surprise that they brought it with them to their new land. \n\nWhile opium smoking was met with disapproval, the endless gambling opportunities found at the Chinese camp caused greater concern. Games of *Fantan*, *Pak ah pu*, and *My pow chong* were played with vigour by Chinese and European men alike at all times of the day and night. \n\nThe disruptive effects of gambling gave rise to the discriminatory White Australia Policy, which limited Chinese immigration well into the 1920s. Across Australia, the Chinese were systematically blamed for crime, violence and corruption—a sentiment echoed in Wagga. \n\nLiving in tightly packed shanties, jumbled together on both sides of Fitzmaurice Street with little by way of sewerage and drainage, Chinese influence was judged to be of moral disruption to the rest of the community. \n\nUndoubtedly there was violence such as the assault of Mrs Ah Fong (aka Ellen Welsh) by her husband who, in January 1876, struck her with a meat cleaver—a blow directed at her head, and one she deftly avoided by stooping, the blow instead landing on her shoulder. \n\nBut drunken, rowdy and violent behaviour had been a feature of the growing community and were not confined to the Chinese—a Court House and Lockup being among the first buildings built in the town in the 1840s, long before the Chinese set eyes on the Murrumbidgee.  \n\nDespite their recreational habits, the Chinese were consistently hard workers. By the mid-1880s, they had built a Chinese Temple, or Joss House close by, cultivated extensive market gardens on North Wagga Island, and opened several large general stores. Many of the men laboured as cooks and general hands on neighbouring properties.\n	"Living in tightly packed shanties, jumbled together on both sides of Fitzmaurice Street with little by way of sewerage and drainage, Chinese influence was judged to be of moral disruption to the rest of the community.

67	Barnet builds a lighthouse	For those familiar with esteemed Government Architect James Barnet’s work, it won’t come as a surprise that in addition to the Australian Museum, Customs House, the Lands Building, Mortuary Station, multiple regional courthouses, and supervising construction of the Great Hall at Sydney University, Barnet also built a lighthouse.	Actually, he built seven. Montague Lighthouse (1881) was his last, and some say his best, after having earned his stripes on Macquarie Lighthouse, the Richmond and Clarence Rivers lighthouses and those at Tacking Point, Crowdy Head and Fingal Head. \nIt was a big task to build a lighthouse on an island and quite a different challenge than presented by those on mainland promontories. Initially, the project stalled after the contractor, Musson & Company, failed to follow Barnet’s directions and the lighthouse had to be relocated some metres from its intended position. Musson eventually surrendered his contract after the SS Monaro bringing labour and supplies to the Island was wrecked. Fresh tenders were called for in 1880.\nBuilder William Jennings—no relation to AV Jennings—took up the reins. He established an efficient supply system early and built a jetty with a hoist and a tramway so he could ferry the 60,000 bricks, 100 casks of cement and 75 sheep to the site. \nHe housed his workforce on the Island and stores were delivered weekly from Narooma. The sheep were let graze freely before one-by-one being slaughtered, cooked and consumed by the hungry workforce.\nBarnet’s handsome light is poised atop the Island’s highest boulder and from there extends almost 12 metres. The light, initially operating on vegetable oil, could be seen for 35 kilometres. It first shone on the night of 1 November 1881 terminating calls for a light on the Island that were first made in 1846 when the Beagle surveyed Bass Strait. The light has guided fisherman, whalers, and sea traffic up and down the coast ever since. \nIn addition to the lighthouse, Barnet oversaw construction of both Keepers’ cottages. Built of cement-rendered brick on concrete foundations the cottages could withstand the harshest of weathers and provided secluded nooks in verandahs where refuge could be sought from every prevailing wind. \nWhile he was onsite at Montague Island Barnet also organised to have granite quarried and sent to Sydney for his extension of the General Post Office building in Martin Place.\n	"The light has guided fisherman, whalers, and sea traffic up and down the coast ever since."\n	\N	\N
88	The queer Captain Moonlite	Stories of bushrangers have been told from many perspectives: from the Irish oppressed by the English point of view; with socially motivated ‘Robin Hood’ overtones; and through the lens of privilege exerted by the squattocracy over disenfranchised rural workers. But up until now, none have asserted that any of the very masculine and often violent bushrangers have been queer.\n	Historian James Willett presents the case for a gay Captain Moonlite in his book *Secret Histories of Queer Melbourne*, and it's a compelling one. He details Andrew George Scott’s (Captain Moonlite) deep attachment to James Nesbitt, who he met in Pentridge Goal while serving time for a bank robbery in Mt Egerton, Victoria.\n\nScott wrote: “Nesbitt and I were united by every tie which could bind human friendship…We were one in hopes, one in heart and soul and this unity lasted until he died in my arms.”\n\nThe ‘death in his arms’ was one of two deaths in the Wantabadgery siege of November 1879, the other being Wagga’s Senior Constable Edward Webb-Bowen.\n\nThe siege occurred after Scott, Nesbitt, Rogan, Johns, Bennett and Wernicke—who, with the exception of Scott were all under 21—approached the owners of Wantabadgery Station for food. They’d walked from Melbourne and had been on the road for a long time and were hungry and tired. The station owners (read here privileged squattocracy) were suspicious of itinerants and alert to the treat of bushrangers, declined to feed or water the men.\n\nWeary and desperate, Scott lost his cool and with gun in hand demanded food and drink for his men. He then bailed up the nearby Australian Arms Hotel and the siege was on. \n\nPolice from Wagga descended on the area, then more arrived from Gundagai and soon gunfire was exchanged. Woefully inexperienced, Moonlite’s gang had never encountered such a situation: Rogan, terrified hid under a bed, and Wernicke, a mere 15 years old, was killed outright. Constable Webb-Bowen was shot in the back and Nesbitt in the head.\n\nWitnessing this, Moonlite “wept over him like a child, laid his head upon his breast, and kissed him passionately”.\n\nScott was arrested and charged with Webb-Bowen’s murder. Awaiting execution, Scott wound a ring of Nesbitt’s hair around his finger and repeatedly requested to be buried beside Nesbitt in Gundagai Cemetery.\n\nHis dying wish was denied—unsurprisingly, having committed the most heinous of crimes—and Moonlite was buried in Rockwood Cemetery. \n\nIn 1992, his body was exhumed and he was finally laid to rest with his best friend and possible lover, James Nesbitt.\n	"Weary and desperate, Scott lost his cool and with gun in hand demanded food and drink for his men."	1875-01-01	\N
99	What’s in a name?\n	Wagga Wagga means ‘place of many crows’. The exact location where the many crows congregated was the waterhole at the western overflow of Flowerdale Lagoon. This was the land claimed by ex-convict George Best, one of the region’s first squatters, in 1832.\n\n	Best’s ‘allotment’ was large—12 miles along the riverfront and 12 miles back from it, the original holding amounting to over 200,000 acres. There remains a family cemetery on site with several family members buried there including son and grandson.\n\nThe early European squatters often named their properties with the Wiradjuri words that defined them: \n\n*Kyeamba* (property claimed by John Smith on the south side of the river) means ‘decorative forehead band’. \n*Eunonyhareenyha* (property claimed by Charles Tompson on the north side of the river) means ‘blacks lying in ambush’.\n*Gobbagombalin* (property claimed by James Thorne to the west of Eunonyhareenya) means ‘turkey egg’.\n\nThe Murrumbidgee River, more accurately written as *Murrumbidgeri* means ‘big water’.\nOther localities in the region also took and kept their Wiradjuri names:\n\n*Grong Grong means ‘hot places’. There are many camp ovens in the surrounding sandhills, though some sources refer to the definition of ‘bad camping ground’.\n*Goolilagumby (now Gumly Gumly)* means ‘man with many boomerangs’.\n*Berry Jerry* (on the road to Narrandera) means ‘low spreading trees’.\n*Ganmain* (between Grong Grong and Wagga) means ‘decorated with scars’.\n*Wantabadgery* (east of Wagga on the river) made infamous by bushranger Captain Moonlite’s (link) killing of Constable Webb-Bowen in 1879. Aptly named, it means ‘fighting place’. \n*Coolamon *(on the Wagga Wagga Road) means ‘dish’ or bowl’.\n*Tooyal* (on the road to Coolamon) means ‘jag of a spear’.\n\n	The Murrumbidgee River, more accurately written as *Murrumbidgeri* means ‘big water’.	\N	\N
14	Great Escapes	Constructed between 1835 and 1842 and finally closed in 2011, Parramatta Gaol is Australia’s oldest surviving correctional centre.  With its high perimeter fence topped with razor wire, solid sandstone walls and heavy steel gates, the dingy abandoned cells are the stuff of nightmares and have been featured in the Channel Nine crime series Underbelly. By the time of its closure it was infested with rats and the ancient plumbing was woefully inadequate. Throughout its history there have been many daring attempts to escape.\n	In 1937 a group of four prisoners attempted to break free from Parramatta Gaol with a homemade skeleton key that they had fashioned in the prison workshop. Unfortunately the key, which was made from a soft metal, jammed in the fourth door. Three of the escapees were then caught in the prison yard and two wardens were suspended.\n\nIn 1953 four dangerous inmates “borrowed” a ladder from inside the prison and tried to scale the outer wall. Only one prisoner, the notorious gunman Antonio Martini, managed to climb over the wall. Martini avoided a hail of warden’s bullets when he jumped the 35 feet to freedom but broke his ankle on landing. He was recaptured in the grounds of the adjoining mental hospital where he was loaded into a wheelbarrow and returned to the gaol. \n\nOne of Parramatta Gaol’s “celebrity” inmates was the infamous bank robber and “Escapologist” Darcy Dugan. A career criminal, Darcy “Houdini” Dugan escaped from custody six times. In 1946 he escaped using a kitchen knife to cut a hole in the roof of a prison tram whilst being escorted to court in Sydney. On another occasion in 1949, Dugan and his accomplice Cecil Meares brazenly escaped from Central Police Station using a hacksaw. His briefest period of incarceration was just 25 minutes spent in Long Bay before he tore through the ceiling, climbed onto a roof and jumped over the prison wall in plain sight.  \n\nIn 1958, whilst detained at Her Majesty’s pleasure at Parramatta Gaol, Dugan sparked a nation-wide man hunt when he was found missing at the midday roll-call. Police and prison officials suspected that Dugan had escaped in a laundry van but he was later found hiding under the floorboards in an outbuilding. Authorities promptly transferred him to solitary confinement at Long Bay.\n\nOne of the more unusual gaol-breaks was reported in the SMH of 1926 when former prisoner Frederick Jacob Anthes attempted to break back in to Parramatta Gaol to retrieve some songs he had written whilst inside. They were found in a pickle bottle buried in the prison garden.	"His briefest period of incarceration was just 25 minutes spent in Long Bay before he tore through the ceiling, climbed onto a roof and jumped over the prison wall in plain sight."	1835-01-01	1842-01-01
24	Food, Water AND... Shelter – ‘The Crescent Estate’ Has It All! 	\nWhen the British first settled Australia, it was not all lush pastures and fertile ground as promised by Cook.  In fact for the newly formed colony the clock was ticking.  The newcomers were starving and new supplies from the old country were not forthcoming.  Little plant life was flourishing in the drought ridden sandy soils and freshwater was scarce. They needed to find fresh water and fertile soils - without delay!	\nToday, it’s difficult to imagine Australia as a place of starvation and desperation.  These days we can get our food delivered to our door and drink from a high street water bubbler.\n\nBut when the first fleet landed in Sydney Cove in 1788, there were no cheering crowds to greet them, only the threat of a slow death by starvation, at the hands of a parched landscape of sandy and infertile soils.  \n\nAs the colony’s supplies diminished, Governor Captain Philip was compelled to lead gruelling scouting journeys to locate fertile soils, along what was later to become known as the Parramatta River.  \n Fortunately, the scouting party discovered an area where the river had scoured into the side of the hill forming a crescent like shape. At this place, Governor Philip had found fertile soils and a supply of fresh water.  He named the area ‘The Crescent.’   \n\nPhilip immediately ordered that military housing, the ‘Redoubt’ be built and by the middle of 1789, both the Crescent and the slope of the ridge were under cultivation. \n\nIn order to speed up construction of the new ‘Crescent Estate,’ a brick and tile yard was set up in 1790 at the east end of the Crescent.  The brickyard was overseen by a Sydney brick maker Samuel Wheeler.  By the end of the year operator James Becket and his 52 workers were making around 25,000 bricks per week ,which were quickly laid to construct the public buildings such as the hospital.  \n\n Within three years about 100 huts had been completed from wattle, woven from acacia branches and daub, of clay or mud. Divisions were established in order to separate the gentry, free settlers and convicts and the ‘Crescent Estate’ was well under way. \n\nGo stand in ‘The Crescent’ today and in the stillness of the park, try and picture the hive of ingenuity and industry that went into creating one of Australia’s first estates.	"...At this place, Governor Philip had found fertile soils and a supply of fresh water.  He named the area The Crescent."\n	1788-01-01	\N
34	A brush with death	In 1865, storekeeper John Emmott narrowly escaped death from the most feared gang of bushrangers in NSW. Returning from nearby goldfields, Emmott was bailed up by members of the Clarke Gang. He tried to ride away but his horse was shot dead from under him. He was then shot in the leg and pistol-whipped before the gang relieved him of 25 ounces of gold dust, a gold watch and cash.   	Though brutal, this incident was significant in the downfall of the gang, which was comprised of a core group including brothers Thomas, John and James Clarke and their uncles Pat and Tom Connell. From 1865-67 the Clarke Gang were responsible for 36 hold-ups and the deaths of five policemen. When Tom Connell was captured and convicted for the robbery and assault of Emmott, the organisation of the group began to break down. All members of the gang were eventually captured and in 1867 John and Thomas were hanged in Sydney.\n\nThe Emmott family was well regarded in town and throughout the region. People thought of them as fair and hard working shop merchants. In 1875, Abraham Emmott built the two houses. He occupied one and his son John, the other. John never fully recovered from his encounter with the bushrangers and walked with a pronounced limp for the rest of his life. From the front verandah Abraham Emmott could look down Moruya’s main street and see his general store, the Emmott “Bee Hive”.\n\nMoruya was a relatively small town with a population that ranged from 500-1000 people in the period of 1870-90. But the region had great influxes of people when gold was discovered first at Araluen, then at Mogo and shortly after at Nerringundah. \n\nThese three dig sites were substantial and attracted miners from Sydney and the Bathurst region. Silver and copper were also found outside Moruya. Lucrative mining activity provided opportunities for local businesses to provide all the mining hardware as well as tents and food. The Emmott stores expanded to Nerringundah and later to Bodalla. \n\nEmmott House and Gibson House were Moruya’s first brick buildings built to a familiar Northern English design. The houses are named after the last occupants and reflect the character of Moruya’s colonial past. \n	"Lucrative mining activity provided opportunities for local businesses to provide all the mining hardware as well as tents and food.

48	The Remarkable Mr Mort	Thomas Sutcliffe Mort was an innovative industrialist, merchant, wool broker, shipbuilder, engineer, dairy farmer, pastoralist and more. Known as the “Father of Bodalla”, Mort established the Bodalla Estate and the All Saints Anglican Church was built in his honour. He was remembered as a kind and generous employer. When considering Mort’s achievements one is left wondering, what didn’t he do?\n	Thomas Sutcliffe Mort was born in Lancashire, England in 1816. Arriving in Sydney in 1838, he began work as a clerk before establishing himself as a highly successful auctioneer and wool broker. In 1848 he was involved in the establishment of AMP and became a director of the Sydney Railway Company. He pursued interests in mining and sugar production and continued to increase his wealth in the speculation and financing of pastoral properties. \n\nIn 1855 Thomas Mort opened his dry-dock in Balmain, later leasing the premises to other shipbuilders and engineers. He devoted his later years to the invention of refrigeration for the purposes of exporting frozen Australian meat.\n\nMort had amassed a sizeable fortune by the 1850s and between 1857 and 1859, he returned to England for a restorative holiday. Although a proud and pious High Anglican, Mort was not parsimonious and could be quite flamboyant in his taste.  \n\nAmong the extravagant purchases he brought back to Australia was an Elizabethan suit of armour, Old English suits of chain mail, a cabinet once belonging to Marie Antoinette and 130 paintings. Once home, he engaged the famous ecclesiastical architect Edmund Blacket to add a personal art gallery onto his Darling Point home which he then opened to the public.\n\nIn 1860 Mort acquired the property ‘Bodalla’ and set to work establishing a model dairy farm. Using new technologies and innovative breeding and dairy processing techniques, he created a thriving enterprise. The Bodalla Estate soon grew to accommodate housing, a shop, school and against his true wishes, a hotel.\n\nMort was also keen to build an impressive church on his property and appointed Edmund Blacket to create the Gothic design. Unfortunately, Mort died before the foundation stone could be laid in 1880. The building was completed in 1901, without its spire. The people of Bodalla dedicated the church to Thomas Mort and his first wife Theresa. It contains many features of specific significance to the Mort family. Mort’s daughters hand-embroidered the textile furnishings, using material from their mother’s wedding dress to create the original altar frontal. Theresa’s wedding ring was also incorporated into the silver gilt chalice.\n\nMort’s last words are carved into the Chancel arch:  \n\n‘THINE EYES SHALL SEE THE KING IN ALL HIS GLORY’\n	\n"In 1860 Mort acquired the property ‘Bodalla’ and set to work establishing a model dairy farm. Using new technologies and innovative breeding and dairy processing techniques, he created a thriving enterprise."	1880-01-01	1902-01-01
59	Magical Mystery Tour	When Penny-farthings were introduced to Australia in the 1870s interest was sluggish. But when the more ergonomic design was introduced in 1887, bicycle sales skyrocketed. Cheaper and more reliable than horses, bicycles became a popular form of transport, and it wasn’t long before bicycle racing was enthusiastically taken up by communities in both cities and rural districts.	Cut into the ground by horse and scoop the Tilba Velodrome track is 400 metres long. Constructed in 1892 by the local community without government funding or assistance, it is located five kms from town on the Mystery Bay turnoff at Corunna Point. Howard Negus donated the land, and perhaps sensing an opportunity, later opened a bicycle sales and repair shop in Tilba. \n\nWithin a few years a pavilion, water tank and other facilities were added. Racing carnivals and other sporting events, dances and picnics were regular events. \n\nBicycle racing was strictly for men only. At the time women were often described as the ‘fairer sex ‘and it was deemed inappropriate, even unhealthy, for women to ride bicycles. And so the races were a competition sport for men and a spectator sport for women.\n\nSadly however, the fad passed and by the early 1900s the cycle club was disbanded and the velodrome track and its buildings fell into disrepair. During the Great Depression homeless and itinerant people occupied the buildings.\n\nThe velodrome looks out over Mystery Bay. But what was so mysterious? Originally called Muttonfish Bay because of the abundance of abalone (mutton fish), in 1880 the bay gained its new name when the abandoned wreck of a small boat was found in mysterious circumstances. \nBoat owner, Thomas Towers was ferrying Government geologist Lamont Young and his assistant Max Schneider and two other men from Bermagui on an expedition to inspect nearby goldfields, when all five men disappeared without trace.\nTheir abandoned boat was found with items of clothing, Young’s papers and books and a bullet lodged in its starboard side. Planks of timber on the bottom of the boat were stove out. \nAn enquiry and police investigation followed but the mystery remains unsolved. \nArthur Upfield’s detective novel The Mystery of Swordfish Reef is based on Young’s disappearance.\n	"The velodrome looks out over Mystery Bay. But what was so mysterious?

68	Seals, Boats, Water Under the Bridge	The coastal town of Narooma sits at the mouth of the Wagonga Inlet. The Narooma Bridge links the northern and southern parts of the town, which is part of the Princes Highway.	The bridge was built between 1929 and 1931 to replace the punt across the Wagonga Inlet. At this time passengers could still travel to Narooma by steamship. It was the first major bridge constructed by the Main Roads Board and links Narooma with Moruya and Bateman’s Bay to the north.\n\nThe bridge, constructed from steel and concrete, is a double bascule span bridge. A bascule bridge, commonly known as a drawbridge, is a moveable bridge that is able to open to provide clearance for boat traffic. The upward swing of the two spans of the bridge is enabled by the counterweights that balance each moveable “leaf” or bridge span. The Spit Bridge across Middle Harbour in Sydney is an example of a single span bascule bridge, with only one section of the bridge rising to let boats pass underneath. Today, Narooma Bridge only opens about five times per month but if you miss this event there are several unique attractions nearby.\n\nFrom the boatsheds at Forster’s Bay, one can follow the Riverside Drive in a northwest direction, towards the mouth of the Wagonga Inlet and towards the open sea. A new pedestrian underpass has been opened to allow walkers to pass under the Narooma Bridge. On the rocks at the mouth of the inlet is an unusual rock formation; a hole that looks just like a map of Australia. Australia Rock is thought to be a natural formation carved by the sea but it has also been suggested that the hole was carved out by ships’ chains.\n\nNarooma Bridge Seafoods sits on the waterfront by the northern side of the bridge. Since 2012 a male Australian fur seal has come to reside at the shop by the bridge and has formed a special relationship with the owner, Sophie Wiersema. Sophie has named the gentle, friendly seal ‘Johnson’ and he comes to her when she calls his name. She does not feed him. He simply seems to enjoy her company. \n\nJohnson arrives in Narooma every April and leaves every October. In 2015 he returned with seriously injured eyes and was nursed back to health by Sophie and a local National Parks veterinarian.\n\nMontague Island, located 9 kilometres southeast of Narooma, is home to a large seal colony. Since the 1800s the seals were hunted for their meat, skins and oil before becoming a protected species in 1974. Attempts are now being made to restore the native vegetation of the island, previously ravaged by introduced species such as rabbits and goats.\n	"On the rocks at the mouth of the inlet is an unusual rock formation; a hole that looks just like a map of Australia. Australia Rock is thought to be a natural formation carved by the sea but it has also been suggested that the hole was carved out by ships’ chains."	1929-01-01	1931-01-01
77	Clyde River tragedy	The rectory was the family home of James Benson who became the rector of All Saints Church in 1926.  He was reverend at the church for four years where he lived with his family, his wife Berthe and four children Peggy, Mary, Jimmy and Barney.  In 1928, when driving home from a camping holiday, with his wife and four children aged from 16 months to nine years old, tragedy struck which changed his life forever.	The Benson Family had left their campsite at Nowra at 6pm to travel through the night to their home in Bodalla. As James Benson reached the northern side of the Clyde River at around 2am, with his wife Berthe and four children Peggy, Mary, Jimmy and Barney asleep in the car unable to see clearly he over-ran the landing stage.   \nJames had mistaken the red light on the approaching punt, for a red safety light, that he had seen at various points on the highway on the trip home. The car wheels slipped on the muddy slope and then plunged into the deep and fast flowing river. James managed to force open the door on the driver’s side and grabbed his wife’s arm in an attempt to drag her from the car. The force of the current rolled the car deeper into the water taking Berthe and the children with it. \nThe car was eventually brought to the surface and the bodies of all but Jimmy were recovered. The body of Jimmy, who was 3, was recovered in a creek 10 days later. James Benson left Bodalla and pledged the rest of his life to celibacy, poverty and chastity.\nThe Clyde River presented many a problem for the surrounding developing townships.  Residents and visitors crossing the Clyde over the centuries relied on rowing, punting, hand-winching and steam-boating across the river.  The Benson Family tragedy on the River Clyde galvanized public outrage resulting in the installation of barrier gates and the first major bridge finally constructed 1 year after their deaths.\nTake a walk to the local cemetery and visit the row of five graves with the great wooden cross that marks the graves of the Benson Family.\n	"James Benson left Bodalla and pledged the rest of his life to celibacy, poverty and chastity."\n	1883-01-01	\N
83	A boat in the baths	There must be hundreds of seaside and riverside pools across NSW. Our fondness of swimming and for constructing suitable hollows for dipping in began early. From treacherous river waterholes to knee-deep rock pools, to concrete-clad baths clinging to the ends of famous beaches; we’ve swum in them all. 	In Moruya, they too wanted a swimming pool. So it was fortuitous that in 1899 when the dredge Archimedes was shifting tonnes of river sand to build a new granite wall and wharf, a natural rock ledge was exposed at the river's edge.\n\nFilling and draining naturally, the 50 by 20 metre inlet soon became the town’s tidal swimming baths.\n\nBut in May 1925 during an unusually wet winter with a swollen river, the steam ship Bermagui, slipped her anchor and washed into the swimming pool. Newspapers reported that the SS Bermagui is “floating within [the swimming pool] in safety”, despite the floodwaters having submerged the wharf and demolished the boat shed. \n\nAnd there she stayed for nearly five weeks. The ship was ‘replaced’ into the river in July after salvage workers broke a hole in the pool wall “and the vessel was floated through the wall and across the shallow river bed to the navigable channel." \n\nIt wasn’t the only incident to beset the SS Bermagui though. The previous year the steamer had run aground further up the coast off Bawley Point. Apparently the Master steering the ship through the channel between the mainland and Brush Island had found the vessel unresponsive. On giving the ‘full steam astern’ command to avoid looming danger firmly ran aground on the Island. \n\nSteamers were an important coastal transport link for passengers and cargo from the late 1800s. The Illawarra Steam Navigation Company had a clutch of steamers, purchasing the SS Bermagui just before WWI. She was commissioned as a Minesweeper during the war, and after a long life was scuttled at the ship graveyard in Moreton Bay in the late 1970s. \n\nPity they couldn't have found her another pool to float in.\n	"The ship was ‘replaced’ into the river in July after salvage workers broke a hole in the pool wall “and the vessel was floated through the wall and across the shallow river bed to the navigable channel.""\n	\N	\N
92	The making of a lake	In 1900, James Gormly decided to build a lake.\n\nThe long-serving Wagga MP and twice Mayor of the town devised a scheme to divert the water of Crooked Creek into Lake Albert—a project that required a dam, a 16ft wide channel and the excavation of 13,000 cubic yards of earth.\n	James Gormly was a man who dreamed bravely. \nNo stranger to adversity, as a child he had been lost in the bush for 48hrs. Then, tragically his mother, father, sister and two brothers drowned in the floods of 1852. James, who was visiting his family in Gundagai at the time of the devastating flood, was washed downstream for over a mile until he dragged himself from the torrent and into a tree. There he clung for 36hrs in freezing conditions before being rescued. \n\nDespite this ‘troubled relationship’ with water, he went on to advocate for a permanent and recreational water supply at Lake Albert.\n\nGormly is an example of what hard work and an eye for opportunity could do for personal fortunes in a pre-federation Australia.\n\nSettling in Wagga in the 1850s, Gormly secured a government mail contract, and with the aid of 300 horses, he was soon delivering mail along 800km of Riverina roads. Selling his business to Cobb & Co in the 1870s he went on to become a selector, with properties first at The Rock, then further afield in Bourke and Nyngan, and embarked on a career as a politician.\n\nAfter making healthy profits on both freehold and selected land, Gormly returned to Wagga and bought up big in urban property, building Foxborough Hall as the family home on prime land in central Wagga. In 1913, when he sold the Hall and its 40 acres to Charles Hardy & Co (link to Conjura story), the estate was advertised as having “proximity, accessibility and altitude”—arguably the best attributes for any piece of land anywhere, and not just for those seeking a spot out the reach of the flood-prone Murrumbidgee.\n\nGormly’s water project at Lake Albert proceeded but not without hiccup. There were numerous complaints about the lack of planning in providing levees at the southern end of the lake. Shoddy works carried out by Public Works to divert water into the lake were blamed for its failure to fill. \n\nDespite the reluctance of water to enter the lake, settlement steadily grew. Designated in 1890 as a Crown subdivision for rural workers, it wasn’t until the 1960s when town beautification programs were completed that Lake Albert fully acquired the features of Gormly’s earliest vision.

100	Shoot straight, you bastards. Don't make a mess of it!\n	Collins Park contains several memorials to commemorate the military service of those men from Wagga Wagga who fought in the Boer War between 1899 and 1902. Almost one hundred men from Wagga were sent to assist the British in their campaign against the Dutch-Afrikaans (Boers) in what is now South Africa. Simmering tensions between the two colonial occupants erupted when diamonds were discovered and the British and the Boers fought for control of the territory.\n	Recruits from the rural areas were reputedly highly valued for their bush skills and ability to fire a gun whilst riding a horse. However, in today’s language, troops were discouraged from behaving as if they were in the ‘Wild West’. In 1902, The Worker newspaper of Wagga, reported that Major General Hutton had addressed the young soldiers of the Third Battalion as they set sail for South Africa. Hutton warned the recruits in no uncertain terms that they were under scrutiny. His words of warning were coloured by recent events when it had been made known that renegade soldier, Harry “Breaker” Harbord Morant, had been arrested, tried, court-martialled and shot for the unauthorized murder of 9 Afrikaner prisoners of war, supposedly in retaliation for the death and mutilation of a mate. Hutton referred to the incident and declared:\n\n*It is not your horsemanship, remember; it is not your marksmanship;\nbut it is the strong individuality of your individual characters that makes you Australians so valuable as soldiers. That individuality is worth nothing, nothing, without discipline.*\n \nWhilst Breaker Morant has become an Australian folk hero for his steadfast loyalty to his mates and disrespect for authority, he was accused of war crimes and executed in 1902. Even before his notoriety in South Africa, Morant was renowned in rural NSW, including Wagga, as a skilled horseman, drover and bush poet. The previously little-known role of Australian troops in the Boer War and the fate of Harry “Breaker” Morant were immortalized in Bruce Beresford’s film, Breaker Morant, of 1980.\n\nWithin Collins Park there is also a memorial to the first and only Wagga man to be killed in the Boer War, Joseph Faustino Palazzi.  He was just 22 years old. An old warship gun, cast in 1795, forms part of the memorials. Although the manner of its arrival in Australia is unclear, the gun was fitted with wheels to be used in 1851 to quell disturbances during the gold field riots. In the late 1800s it was brought to Wagga to be used to signal the hour of noon, as the town had no clock. Originally located at the racecourse, it was used in later times only on Empire Day before being moved to the park. 	"Even before his notoriety in South Africa, Morant was renowned in rural NSW, including Wagga, as a skilled horseman, drover and bush poet."	1934-01-01	\N
15	Olympic Swimmers Get Fresh in Parramatta Park	In 1914 Little Coogee, the beach swimming area in Parramatta Park, hosted the Olympic Carnival. The Stockholm Olympics, held two years earlier, saw efforts hampered because the Australian Olympians had been trained in salt water and not the fresh water in which they had to compete.  Little Coogee provided the ideal training conditions to protect the gold in the next Olympics – fresh water!\n	It may seem incredible today to think that Olympic swimming carnivals were held in the Parramatta River, given its current somewhat polluted state.  Nevertheless, Little Coogee became a popular, if not unofficial bathing and picnic spot from as early as the 1890’s.\n\n The beach area of Little Coogee takes its name, from when members of the Coogee Life Saving Club visited for a lifesaving and resuscitation exhibition in 1912. That same year also saw the sport of swimming enter a new phase as Sydney’s ‘lady’ swimmers fought and won the right to compete at the Stockholm Olympic Games.\n\nAs much as swimming in the river seems unbelievable today, so does the idea that women were not permitted to swim in front of men. Deemed unladylike to both compete and immoral to be seen in a swimsuit in the presence of men, competitive swimming was simply not considered acceptable for women. \n\nIt was two Sydney women, Fanny Durack and Mina Wylie who overcame convention, and at their own expense, competed in the 1912 games, and won gold and silver for Australia, while the men secured only one gold in the relay. \n\nAs the international competition from Germany, America and Britain began to heat up, so did the pressure to train and get ready for Berlin and this is how the Carnival came to be at Little Coogee.  If the competition was in fresh water, then the preparation must be too.\n\n7000 people watched the day’s events.  With no marked off lanes, no ropes and not even able to see the bottom, the competitors swam remarkably, with few incidents.  The newspapers all reported on the overwhelming success of the day. Whilst the Park had been flooded in the lead up to the event, leaving the river with a muddy hue, Parramatta Park, ‘never greatly prized,’ was touted as finally serving a purpose.  \n\nTalk a walk to Little Coogee, close your eyes and travel back in time to Saturday April 4th 1914, if you listen carefully you can almost hear the crowds cheering.	"As much as swimming in the river seems unbelievable today, so does the idea that women were not permitted to swim in front of men."	1817-01-01	\N
25	River Real Estate Yo-yo	Just upstream from the Crescent on the traditional hunting and fishing grounds of the Burramatta clan of the Dharug people, a shuffle of buildings perch in picturesque view of the river. It’s a prime piece of real estate and one that’s been in and out of Government hands since Dispossession began. 	This now vacant site was the original home of The Old King’s School, the first private boarding school in NSW, although European use of the land began much earlier. Governor Phillip, motivated by increasing demand on food supplies, had supported several agricultural initiatives in the area, including Experiment Farm allocated this land for cultivation as part of Government Farm.\n\nThe 100 convicts assigned here toiled with early success. A 12-kilogram cabbage was delivered to Phillip just before Christmas in 1789, which is a lot of cabbage in anyone’s reckoning. The following year the land was planted with wheat, barley, oats and maize. \n\nThe 105-acres then became one of three allocations given to William Bligh in 1806 just before he became Governor. Collectively named Mount Betham, it was intended for his private residence however, after some colonial argy-bargy the land was returned to the Government. In the 1820s it was granted to the Agricultural and Horticultural Society for use as an orchard nursery. \n\nWithin ten years it again yo-yoed back into Government hands again before being gifted in 1832 to The King's School. The school, offering tried and true Anglican education, opened in 1832 with a somewhat meagre complement of three boys. After occupying the site for 130 years, the school vacated in the 1960s to North Parramatta, taking every block of their Chapel with them. The site went back into Government hands.\n\nOver time, architects’ Ambrose Hallen, John Verge, Mortimer Lewis, Horbury Hunt, the Blacket Brothers and John Sulman all variously had their say in building designs, so the site today parades a medley of styles and architectural egos. \n\nDespite the assortment of buildings being unsuitable for many uses, in 1964 the Marsden Rehabilitation Centre was ushered in.\n\nExtensive remodelling occurred to accommodate, train and deliver services to people with intellectual disabilities. Arguably, its use by the Health Department linked the modern day with the long history of health and social initiatives originating within the city, including the Female Orphan School, Protestant Orphan School, the Lunatic Asylum and those within the Female Factory Precinct. The use of the site for health related services continued until 2003 when the last programs closed, and the buildings became redundant.\n\nSadly, today the site sits idle, though not unwanted. Recent tussles between the Department of Education and arts and cultural advocates, who each want to be the next tenants of the site, see the land as valuable bounty. 	"The use of the site for health related services continued until 2003 when the last programs closed, and the buildings became redundant."	1833-01-01	\N
35	Island sickness	Despite being only nine km from the mainland, those on Montague Island suffered from isolation, often called ‘Islanditis’ or ‘Rock sickness’. However, history shows several more pressing events occurred on the Island when no help was forthcoming.	The several graves on the Island tell a sad story. Mrs Burgess, Headkeeper’s wife, buried two of her children there: the first, John, died in 1888 at the age of 2 years 10 months from unknown causes. Two years later her daughter Isabella, died from whooping cough. \n\nIn 1894 the Assistant Keeper Charles Townsend died when his horse bolted overthrowing the cart he was in which landed on Townsend injuring him. He died in great agony 12 hours later, long before medical help could arrive.\n\nIn 1910, not long after the Narooma Pilot Station began operating, Morse signal lamps were installed on the Island, which allowed communication on a clear night. During the day, the Pilot Station flew signal flags, but this also relied on clear weather.\n\nThe keepers were proficient in signalling and received most of the news from the mainland by Morse, including news of the end of the WWI. Ian Cameron, son of Headkeeper Jock Cameron, said “The newspaper would come by bus to Narooma late afternoon. Most nights Pilot Bill Lubbock would transmit the day’s news to my mother and father using the Morse lamp. Sometimes it took more than an hour. Mum and Dad were both expert at signalling”.\n\nThere were also medical emergencies. In 1939, the Lightkeeper’s son fell and injured his head. Attempts to signal the mainland failed, so a decision was made to sail the injured boy and his mother to Narooma for medical attention. Fortunately, the weather was kind to them and made it safely to the mainland.\n\nThat same year, a pedal operated radio receiver was installed to allow communication with Norah Head Lighthouse, but again this was hampered by inclement weather. And it didn’t help Headkeeper Jim O’Brien in 1953 when he was taken ill and needed to be evacuated from the Island. He had become so sick that the priest was called, and the family began a vigil for his recovery.  \n\nIn the 1960s, a radio telephone was finally installed to connect those at Montague Island to Narooma. Soon after the Royal Flying Doctor Service supplied the Island with a whizz-bang medical kit and today provides emergency medical advice and evacuation by helicopter if necessary.\n\n\n	"In 1939, the Lightkeeper’s son fell and injured his head.

46	“You’ll never take me alive!” said he	\nWollundry Lagoon is a natural billabong in the heart of Wagga.\nThe Victory Memorial Gardens are located at the eastern end of the lagoon, close to the Murrumbidgee River. Within the gardens rests a copper statue of the Jolly Swagman, the folkloric character immortalized in Banjo Patterson’s famous bush ballad, Walzing Matilda. Don’t know the story of Australia’s unofficial national anthem? Shame on you! But then not many do.\n	Banjo Patterson was born near Orange in 1864. When he was seven, his family moved to the Yass district, approximately 200 kilometres from Wagga. There, Patterson witnessed the characters and sights that he would later write about. He loved to see the drovers and bullock teams moving through the country and was enthralled by the skills of the horsemen from the Murrumbidgee and Snowy Mountain areas that he would see at local picnic races and polo games.\n\nPatterson wrote the words to Walzing Matilda in 1895 whilst staying at Dagworth, a sheep and cattle station in Winton, Queensland. The words were written to a tune played on a zither by Christina McPherson, which was based on ‘The Craigielee March’, itself derived from a Scottish Celtic folk tune. The title does not refer to fond memories of dancing with a young lady but rather to the bush tradition of travelling on foot seeking work. ‘Walzing’ was an Australian slang word derived from the German term auf der Walz, meaning travelling on the job. ‘Matilda’ was slang for swag, the sack of few possessions that the swaggie would sling over his back.\n\nThe song tells the story of an itinerant worker, or ‘swagman’, making a bush camp on the banks of a billabong. He sits under the shade of a ‘coolibah’ tree, a wide-spreading Eucalyptus, while he boils the billy to make tea and captures a sheep, the ‘jumbuck’, to eat. He is confronted by the sheep’s owner, the squatter, and three policemen who come to arrest the swagman for theft. But he flings himself into the billabong, preferring to drown than be captured and his ghost haunts the site of the billabong evermore.\n\nWalzing Matilda was on the story of the Great Shearer’s Strike of Queensland in 1891. To quell the unrest, the Premier of Queensland called in the military. By 1894, some of the shearers on Dagworth Station were again on strike. Violence erupted and the shearers fired their guns in the air and set fire to the woolshed, killing dozens of sheep. The owner of the station and three policemen chased down a man named Samuel (Frenchy) Hoffmeister. Rather than be captured, Hoffmeister shot and killed himself at the Combo Waterhole.  \n\nAlthough the song was inspired by events in Queensland, the setting and imagery of the ballad is reminiscent of the country of Patterson’s youth. The statue of the Jolly Swagman was created by the Swiss-Australian sculptor, Aurel Ragus, and unveiled in the gardens in 1978. The solemn, sinuous figure of the swagman merges with the tree he sits against. He is represented as very much a part of the billabong landscape in which he rests.\n	" ‘Walzing’ was an Australian slang word derived from the German term auf der Walz, meaning travelling on the job. ‘Matilda’ was slang for swag, the sack of few possessions that the swaggie would sling over his back."	\N	\N
51	Mixed Business	Bates General Store, Central Tilba, has had many tenants and housed several different businesses. It was built in 1895 as a butcher shop and residence. In the early 1900s it was extended to accommodate a produce and oil store that was clad with pressed metal. It has served as a bakery, a general store including fresh produce and farming supplies, a garage, post office, restaurant, art gallery and Bed and Breakfast.	General stores existed in Central Tilba (at least two), Tilba Tilba and at the Mountain View estate owned by the Bate family. The hamlet of Central Tilba was established about fifteen years after Tilba Tilba and was predominantly built between 1895 and 1908.\n\nAt the time of the area’s gold rush, from the early 1890s to 1906, Tilba was prosperous and both Central Tilba and Tilba Tilba benefitted from the influx of prospectors. By 1897 both villages had a post office, store, dairy factory, hall and accommodation.\n\nThe Bates General Store is located in Bate Street, Central Tilba. It was originally built and owned by local merchants Crapp and Boxswell in 1895 who ran a thriving business selling and delivering supplies (by wagon) up and down the South Coast, from Moruya to Bega. The first post office was located in the building and later a garage was added.\n\nIn 1908 a fire devastated the premises of Crapp and Boxswell, with very few of the contents of the “bakehouse” being able to be saved. The items destroyed included a bale of cheese binding, valued at £50 two tons of flour, a quantity of salt and 200 loaves of bread. Remarkably, this was the second time the building had gone up in flames. Only eighteen months previously it had been destroyed by fire and then rebuilt to be ‘fire-proof’ with hardwood and iron. Sadly, believing that a second disaster would be impossible, Mr Crapp and Mr Boxswell did not see fit to insure the building.\n\nToday, Bates General Store is renowned for Mrs Jamieson’s Tilba Fudge, a hand-made delicacy produced from local cream and butter and boasting 117 different flavous!\n\nRead more about the Bates General Store and Model T Ford cars here (link to Bates General Store_AD_story#2)\n	"In 1908 a fire devastated the premises of Crapp and Boxswell, with very few of the contents of the “bakehouse” being able to be saved.

61	A pub with no beer	A camel can go for a long time without a drink so to name a hotel after a camel seems a bit odd, unless it's a reference to how much a camel can drink. But the funny thing is that once upon a time, you really couldn't get a drink at this hotel! 	Originally called the Palace Hotel, it took its name from its immediate heritage—the coffee palace. Introduced into Australia as part of the temperance movement, in the 1880s, a coffee palace was about as chic as you could get. With a congenial atmosphere that welcomed women and families and attracted the middle classes, coffee palaces provided dining halls, accommodation, games and entertainment, and reading rooms. They fostered conversation and attracted the intellectuals of the day. And they were quite unlike the average Aussie hotel.\nFor nearly a hundred years, from the gold rushes of the 1850s to the start of WWI, the control of alcohol and the abolition of the liquor trade was a major political issue. According to researcher Diana Noyce, in the years of 1911-25 referenda to limit or prohibit the sale of alcohol were held in most states in Australia, with 1:3 respondents supporting prohibition. And the temperance movement with its allied support organisations like the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union was at the hub of this debate. \nSo right on cue, in 1895, Mr and Mrs Livingstone built their alcohol-free coffee palace in Tilba. Unlike nearby Moruya that had long been a stage for Irish vs English and Catholic vs Protestant tussles, Tilba was a Methodist town. This cohesive community welcomed good, clean fun, so as well as enjoying the Palace Hotel, Tilburnians also patronised the Temperance Hall, (link to Temperance Hall Story). \nDespite featuring prominently in Tilba, the coffee palace era was relatively short-lived. Hard to financially sustain and unable to complete with establishments providing a full range of ‘refreshing beverages’ many coffee palaces had closed by the turn of the century. So the Palace Hotel also took to the drink, proving as some predicted, “abstinence doesn’t pay”.\nIn 1946, the Palace Hotel became the Dromedary Hotel, after the Mount Dromedary gold fields that had ceased to make anyone rich for at least 60 years before the hotel was renamed. In 2006, Mount Dromedary was returned to the traditional owners, the Yuin people, and today goes by its traditional name, Mt Gulaga.\n	"Hard to financially sustain and unable to complete with establishments providing a full range of ‘refreshing beverages’ many coffee palaces had closed by the turn of the century.

76	The House on the Hill	Next door to the Presbyterian Church stands the 150 year old Manse, home for the minister.  From its spot on the ridge, the simple and symmetrical Manse, built from local eucalypt and New Zealand Kauri pine, was spared the perennial floods and stands today as a testimony, not solely to religious conviction but to an enduring community.  	That the Manse exists at all is mostly down to the pioneering Scottish Presbyterians whose community spirit, which largely developed as a result of marrying within the faith, rallied together to secure a home for the Reverend.\nReverend Patrick Fitzgerald arrived in Moruya in 1863.  He was one of twenty-two aspiring Presbyterian Ministers who made the journey from Britain under the sponsorship of Reverend Lang on the ship Clifton. \n\nThe building of the Manse largely came about as a result of an embarrassing rental dispute, which confirmed that the Reverend Fitzgerald must have a house. Reverend Lang’s sister in law, Helen guaranteed the funding in the shape of a £300 tax-free advance and paid off all the debt eight years later.  \nThe Manse was built in isolation at the end of a track, on the boundary of the town overlooking the river.  That it still survives today, is in large part, due to its location high on a granite hill as just two years prior, the river had flooded, wreaking havoc on the local property and crops.  At the time, the location of the church and Manse was seen as impractical, as the men would be unlikely to leave their work to attend services.  \nReverend Fitzgerald’s service in Moruya lasted 8 years, during which time they suffered through at last three catastrophic floods.  His departure was in some part due to these floods which had left many in the town broke, but also due to the diminishing gold supply which took the congregation of miners to new goldfields.\nThe Manse is not just a home, it is a tribute to community.  The Presbyterians, the builders, generous benefactors and committed volunteers, whose very existence are woven into the very fabric of its being.\nYou are invited to hear their stories, take a wander up to the Manse today and ponder the efforts made by the small community, to get their Minister a home. \n	"Reverend Fitzgerald’s service in Moruya lasted 8 years, during which time they suffered through at least three catastrophic floods.

85	Designed by our very own ‘Fat Controller’ of colonial railways.	John Whitton was a champion. In the day where horse-drawn carriages on tram lines were proposed as a solution to NSW’s transport woes, he had the backbone and determination to push for a something far more inspired. \n	A Yorkshireman through and through, Whitton brought with him to Australia more than a long experience as a railway engineer. He bought a much-needed stubborn disposition. \n\nVisionary in his advocacy for standardised rail gauges, the use of iron bridges instead of timber, and for building a railway able to accommodate bigger, heavier and longer loads than before, he had plenty of detractors of his plans. He opted for imported steel rails over locally produced iron rails. Having worked in Sheffield and Manchester he probably knew good steel from bad but the decision brought him little joy with local manufacturers and politicians needing to secure their patches. \n\nHe also knew how beautiful railway stations should look.\n\nWagga Wagga Railway Station was his first attempt at designing one, and he gave it an impressive forecourt, a circular carriageway and extensive gardens. In keeping with the Victorian architectural tendencies, he chose a symmetrical layout, central entry, and added the then, very chic and modern wrought-iron lacework as a decorative feature.\n\nWhitton understood the massive expansion needed to connect regional centres into the transport grid. He understood the importance of thwarting Victoria’s developing economic prowess—something not to be taken lightly during the agricultural wool and wheat boom in the Riverina at the time.\n\nWhile Victoria was using the Murray River to transport wool to Echuca and from there to Melbourne by rail, NSW was lagging in the train game. The development of the Great Southern Line connecting Albury with Sydney was announced in the 1870s. But there had been the vast expanse of the Murrumbidgee to cross—necessitating the construction of the most expensive bridge (link) in Australia—and the Snowy Mountains to skirt around, so it all took time and money.\n\nThe station opened in 1878 as South Wagga Wagga, then Bomen, and renamed as Wagga Wagga in 1882 as the Great Southern Line kicked into operation. Today, the Rail Heritage Museum occupy half the station building with displays and information about the rail heritage of the area.\n\nJohn Whitton is said to be the “father of NSW railways”. But in reality, he's more like the 'big daddy.' Stop by his memorial at Sydney’s Central Station and say hello.	"Whitton understood the massive expansion needed to connect regional centres into the transport grid. He understood the importance of thwarting Victoria’s developing economic prowess."	1879-01-01	\N
91	Wahn the Crow	There are many Wiradjuri stories about the mischievous Crow. The following story explains the reason for the hostility between the Pelicans and the Crows.\n	One day, Wahn the Crow, came across a Pelican camp. As custom dictated, he did not enter the camp immediately but waited some time to be invited in.\n\nOnce he was sitting by the campfire, the hospitable Pelicans offered him the best of their food and shelter to sleep in. In the morning he awoke to find the camp deserted as all the Pelicans had gone off to seek food. Wahn was greatly annoyed and offended that no breakfast had been prepared for him. But, he was also aching all over and believed that his dream spirit had been poorly treated during the night. Wahn took great umbrage at what he perceived to be an inexcusable insult to a guest and determined to seek revenge.\n\nAs he wandered about the campsite he heard the crying of babies. Looking up, he saw that the tree branches were full of Pelican babies, placed there for safekeeping by there mothers. Wahn resolved to catch a Pelican baby for his breakfast but could not reach them. He tried to chop footholds into the trunk to climb the tree but the tribe’s axe would not cooperate. He then tried to burn the tree down with a fire stick but again, as the property of the Pelicans, the fire stick refused to do them any harm and would not burn.\n\nOut of spite, the Crow decided that if he could not have the babies then neither would their parents. He called on the bush spirits, the Tuckonies, to make the trees grow. Soon the trees grew so high that the babies were lost from sight and Wahn fled.\n\nWhen the Pelican mothers returned they could not find their babies and began to wail. The babies cried but could not be seen and soon all the animals arrived to see what the commotion was. The Hawk spied the babies and the Goanna and Possum tried to rescue them but were unable. At last, only one shy little bird, a Brown Tree-Creeper named Bimbin, was able to reach the babies and worked tirelessly, hopping up and down the tree trunk until all the Pelican babies were back safe.\n\nSince that day Brown Tree-Creepers have always been welcomed by the Pelicans and regarded with affection by the Wiradjuri people. The Crow however has since been despised and avoided by the Pelican.\n 	"Since that day Brown Tree-Creepers have always been welcomed by the Pelicans and regarded with affection by the Wiradjuri people."	\N	\N
97	Moruya Rocks!	Vivian Cottage is a survivor of the first residential expansion phase in Moruya. Whilst there is nothing fancy or unusual about this house, its value lies in the fact that there are so few homes from this period still in existence. This Cottage is extraordinary, not for outstanding architecture or famed owners, but for its ability to link us directly to the pioneering settlers like the Williams family, who arrived in the secluded township of the South Coast almost 150 years ago.	Peter Williams arrived in Australia in 1859, sailing into Sydney from Cornwall, with his wife Theresa and 2 children. The sailing ship ‘Hornet’ was 4 months at sea and their eldest son may have just lived long enough to see the Sydney Heads. Shortly after burying their son, they headed off once more, perhaps on foot, or by packhorse, carrying their few belongings, down the narrow bush tracks to Moruya. \nUpon arriving in their new home town they built their weatherboard cottage on Campbell Street. Peter named their home ‘Vivian Cottage,’ after his blue blooded relatives back in Cornwall, the Vivian family. Built of weatherboard this cottage remained in the care of the Williams Family until their daughter Harriet’s death in 1956. \nThe village of Moruya had been surveyed 30 years prior to the Williams family arrival, with James Gee the first settler and Vulcan Street named after his trade. Between the burgeoning dairy industry and the quarrying for granite, the need for implements and equipment would have kept the local smithies busy.\nVulcan Street was also the location for Peter Williams blacksmith operation.  Williams was a trained and talented blacksmith, so it’s likely his skills would have been used to make tools for both removing and shaping the granite in the late 1850’s.  \nMoruya was to provide granite for many Sydney Landmarks well into the next century, including the Martin Place Bank and Post office. However, Moruya’s great claim to fame was providing the stone for the piers and pylons of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\nBy the mid 1920’s, the call of the kookaburra had been drowned out by the roar of machinery; the whirring of drills and blasting of rock. By the time the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened in 1932, 173,000 blocks of Moruya granite had been shipped to Sydney.  It may have been a blessing that Williams, who was well known for his love of poetry and the old world, died before granite town took hold of his peaceful bush town of Moruya .  \n	"Moruya was to provide granite for many Sydney Landmarks well into the next century, including the Martin Place Bank and Post office."	1875-01-01	\N
17	The Stargazer, the Pure Merinos and the Emancipists	The Woolpack Hotel is one of the oldest pubs in Australia’s history. As one of the original watering holes welcoming all “classes” of colonial society, its patrons included wealthy pastoralists, clergy, military officers, free settlers and pardoned convicts alike. Their coexistence was not always civil and the Woolpack Hotel marks the site of one of the more acrimonious incidents highlighting the antagonism between those who came to the colony freely and those who were sent as punishment.	In December 1825, the Woolpack Hotel hosted the infamous Emancipist Banquet to farewell the retiring governor, Governor Brisbane. \n\nOriginal proprietor Andrew Nash had named the hotel “Woolpack” in recognition of the area’s significance in establishing Australia’s wool industry.  Prominent citizens and woolgrowers including John McArthur and Reverend Samuel Marsden regularly met at the inn to discuss agriculture and commerce.\n\nAs free-settlers with no penal history, they regarded themselves as morally and socially superior to those of “dubious” character who had arrived in the colony as convicts even after the prisoners had been pardoned. For their prejudice, they became known variously as the ‘Exclusionists’, ‘Exclusivists’, the ‘Aristocrats’ and the ‘Pure Merinos’.\n\nGovernor Brisbane saw little distinction between the emancipists and the free-settlers. As an advocate for the emancipists, he frequently raised the ire of the free-settlers. Privately, they derided his fanciful passion for amateur astronomy and referred to him as the Stargazer. However, they were also keen to maintain their association with a Vice-Regal representative and in October of 1925, they issued an invitation to the Governor to attend a farewell dinner in his honour at the Woolpack Hotel.\n\nThe emancipists also wanted to farewell the Governor and they too issued him with an invitation. Not wishing to attend two farewell events, Governor Brisbane proposed that the two dinners be combined and suggested to the Exclusivists that they include six prominent members of the Emancipist group.  Outraged, the Exclusivists, including McArthur and Marsden, promptly withdrew their invitation and cancelled the dinner. \n\nIn December, Governor Brisbane attended the Emancipist Banquet at the Woolpack, resplendent in his royal blue and gold attire, entering the premises to splendid fanfare from the military band. \n\nIronically, the second location of the Woolpack Hotel had originally been the site of the Reverend Marsden’s first Church.

27	FORTITER ET FIDELITER: The Kings School Motto	Harrisford House was the first site of The King’s School, Australia’s oldest independent school. Built in 1829, Harrisford was leased by the King’s School from its foundation in 1832 until 1836, when the school outgrew the premises and moved to another location on the banks of the Parramatta River. The Anglican school was initially founded for the sons of settlers, civil officials and military officers.	Since 1832, the King’s School has produced many famous alumni including the NSW Premier, Mike Baird, film director Bruce Beresford and rugby player Stirling Mortlock.\n\nThe first Headmaster was the Reverend Robert Forrester. Forrester left England with his young wife Jane in September 1931, arriving in Sydney in January 1832. Shortly after, the King’s School opened in February 1932 with a cohort of 12 students being six boarders and six day boys.\n\nUnder Forrester’s leadership the school flourished and by the end of the year there were approximately one hundred students enrolled. The Reverend was regarded as being stern but enthusiastic and was reportedly well liked by the boys. The boys often sang for the headmaster and his wife, composing the following couplet:\n'Long Bob and slender Jane —\nOne gives physics and the other cane.'\n\nA fascinating insight into the early years of the school is to be found in a book written by one of its earliest pupils, the Reverend James Hassall (1823-1904),\ngrandson of the Reverend Samuel Marsden. In his book of reminiscences Old Australia: records and reminiscences from 1794' in 1902, Hassall recalls the tedium of the school day:\n ‘Morning, noon, and night...we had to learn the everlasting Eton Latin\ngrammar parrot-like, as we learnt the Church catechism.’\n\nThe Reverend Hassall also describes one famous incident of insubordination when, one St Patrick’s Day, the boys locked Reverend Forrester out of the schoolroom because he had refused to give them a half-holiday. Mrs Forrester came to the window and appealed to the boys to open the doors as the Reverend, who was utterly incensed, had determined to go to Colonel Despard and return with soldiers from the nearby garrison. The boys relented.\n\nHassall also wrote of the “peculiar” peaked caps, short jackets and hot trousers comprising the uniform of the day.  \n\nToday, the uniform is of a military design and has remained aesthetically unchanged since 1869.	" Morning, noon, and night...we had to learn the everlasting Eton Latin\ngrammar parrot-like, as we learnt the Church catechism. "	1823-01-01	1829-01-01
36	Schooling the Natives	Aboriginal people have been much maligned in our history. We have portrayed them as primitive, as barbarians, as wildlings to be tamed. They were seen as unequal to their colonisers, a view that persists in the minds of some. But this coloured view prevents us from seeing humanness in others—and in particular, intelligence, humour, and Aboriginal people's deep affection for their children.	In 1814, Governor Macquarie, for reasons of goodwill (and to appease past wrongs), initiated an annual feast in Parramatta’s market square. He invited the local Aboriginal tribes and implored their chiefs to come along. He fed them, gave out gifts and behaved as an all-round nice guy. And hoping for recruitments, he introduced to them the idea of his Native School.\n\nLocated on church land to the northeast of St John’s, the school was the brainchild of William Shelley of the London Missionary Society, who convinced Macquarie that to 'improve' and 'civilise' Aboriginal children would benefit all.\nNot that Macquarie probably needed much convincing, the colony having demonstrated a commitment to education through schools of industry, its orphan schools, and the infamous Female Factory.\n\nMacquarie attracted only eight students that year. The 1818 feast, amid general bonhomie and gifted breastplates for chiefs, and beer and blankets for others, (you can see how this will end) attracted another nine. Over the life of the Institute in Parramatta and despite Macquarie’s well-attended recruitment drives, only 37 students were enrolled.\n\nAboriginal people were reluctant to give up their children. They already had a successful method of raising their children; a task shared by the whole community, where skills were learnt through practical experience. Playfulness and laughter were common, and deep affection for children existed in all mobs and tribes. Theirs was an education system that had stood the test of time. \n\nSo when Aboriginal children were squirrelled away indoors, only to see their parents on the annual feast day, parents began gathering at the school waiting to catch glimpses of their loved ones. The school, worried by the distraction this may cause to the students in their clutches erected a wooden fence to deter the eager eyes of mums and dads. \n\nDespite Macquarie's insistence on the success of the Institute, truants were more common than new attendees and enrolments waned. Relocated in 1823 to Rooty Hill to become the Black Town Native Institution, it closed in 1831, and the last girls transferred to the Female Orphan School.	"Playfulness and laughter were common, and deep affection for children existed in all mobs and tribes. Theirs was an education system that had stood the test of time."	1822-01-01	\N
43	Scots and Stones	The Abernethy and Co. Stonemason’s lathe was used to cut and shape the granite columns and balustrades used in many of Sydney’s finest Victorian buildings. Engineered in Aberdeen, the lathe is just part of the history of Moruya granite which is inextricably linked with the many indomitable Scottish people who immigrated to Australia in the 1800s.	By the 1800s, the Scottish stonemasons of Aberdeenshire were already famous for their excellent craftsmanship in stonemasonry. When the Sydney construction firm Loveridge and Hudson needed a stonemasons lathe, they looked Abernethy and Coin Aberdeen to provide one. The lathe, made in 1881 was shipped to Sydney in 1882.\n\nQuarrying for granite in the Moruya area began in the early 1860s by two Scottish brothers, Joseph and John Flett Louttit who had emigrated to Australia from the Orkney Islands in the north of Scotland. Four main quarries were established in Moruya: the Louttit’s, the Government, Ziegler’s and the McCredies. One of the first projects using Moruya granite was in the construction of training walls used to create a navigable sea channel at the mouth of the Moruya River. It was another Scottish immigrant, Pilot Station Controller, Captain Ross, who noticed that the granite used in these walls was similar in quality to the granite in Aberdeen, Scotland. He sent a sample to the Colonial Architect in Sydney, Mr James Barnet, on a schooner named “Woodpecker” and the granite then became known for its fine quality and colour and became highly sought after for many public building projects.\n\nThe Louttit Quarry produced the granite for the pillars of the General Post Office in Martin Place (1872) and for the base of the Captain Cook Statue in Hyde Park. The Abernethy lathe was used to shape the stone and was later used to fashion the columns adorning the Queen Victoria Building and Custom’s House, the twenty four columns inside St Mary’s Cathedral and the pedestal of the Queen Victoria Statue, all in Sydney.\n\nThere is some confusion as to whether the lathe remained in Sydney or whether it was transported to Moruya although there are photos that appear to show the lathe working in Louttit’s Quarry. This example of Victorian machinery was rare for its size and ability to be moved, assembled as it was from components of cast iron.\n\nThe Scottish connection with Moruya granite continued when, in 1924, the British engineering firm, Dorman, Long and Co. won the contract to construct the Sydney Harbour Bridge. They took over the Government Quarry and in 1925, imported ninety Scottish stonemasons and their families, establishing a dedicated village named Granite Town to house them. The Quarry Master was a young Scottish stonemason, John Gilmore, who was appointed to the position after his wife, Mary, found an ad in the newspaper, which came wrapped around her meat purchase.\n	"The Scottish connection with Moruya granite continued when, in 1924, the British engineering firm, Dorman, Long and Co. won the contract to construct the Sydney Harbour Bridge."	1881-01-01	\N
52	The Brighton of the South	The pretty boatsheds at Riverside Drive, Narooma, are a living reminder of the south coast’s rich maritime history. In 1933, owners were cautioned about the dilapidated condition of some of the boatsheds and they were duly spruced up. By 1936 one visitor to the area was so impressed that he compared it favourably to Old Blighty, describing Narooma as ‘the Brighton of the South’.	Narooma was declared a port town in 1884. Before proper roadways were built, steamships would dock there bringing supplies and hopeful gold prospectors to the region, returning to Sydney with cargo including local dairy products, seafood and gold.\n\nThe area has always been blessed with an abundance of sealife and birdlife,\nwhich sustained the local indigenous people, the Yuin, for many thousands of years. Evidence of this can be seen in the number of shell middens insert link? \nhttp://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nswcultureheritage/ShellMiddens.htm in the area around Lake Wagonga. The boatsheds and their jetties were mostly built in the 1930s to service the burgeoning fishing and boat-building industries.\n\nBy the 1930s Narooma had become a fashionable tourist destination. Then, as now, fishing was a popular sport with anglers enjoying the abundance of bream, flathead and salmon in the bay and Lake Wagonga and larger fish such as kingfish, yellow fin and marlin in the sea around Montague Island. In 1936, interest in big-game fishing was boosted when the famous American author and big-game fisherman, Zane Grey, visited the area, setting up camp at Bermagui for eight weeks. Reports of his ‘monster’ catches of swordfish and his extravagant fishing equipment spread and curious onlookers trespassing on ‘his campsite’ were reprimanded by him for being brazen ‘celebrity hunters’.\n\nWitnessing the plentiful supply of salmon it was Grey who suggested that the area would be perfectly suited for a fish cannery. Indeed, the first fish cannery in Australia was established in Narooma in 1936, processing tuna and salmon. However, by the late 1930s the primary industry in the town was tourism and locals begged authorities to ban the practice of net fishing so that supplies would not be depleted. To ensure that both the cannery and tourism thrived, Henry Jefferson Bate proposed to Parliament that the use of fish pens be allowed in the bay so that the cannery could take advantage of the ‘floods of salmon’ that passed by its door. It was agreed and all were happy until one season, a worker left one of the pen gates open and all the salmon escaped, never to return to the area.\n\nToday the boatsheds are still used for commercial and leisure activities, including charter boat hire for fishing expeditions and whale watching. The annual Narooma Boats Afloat festival, which celebrates the tradition of the handcrafted wooden boat, takes place in Forster’s Bay, with boats being launched and judged from the boatshed jetties.\n	 "It was agreed and all were happy until one season, a worker left one of the pen gates open and all the salmon escaped, never to return to the area."\n	\N	\N
71	The Wagga Lily and Purple Straw	The Murrumbidgee Co-operative Mill was officially opened in June 1890 and was then the largest flourmill in NSW outside of Sydney. When it opened there were two hundred and forty shareholders, most of which were wheat farmers from the Wagga district. The mill worked day and night, six days a week. By 1896, two hundred tons were being processed per week, supplying both the local district and Sydney market.\n	The mill was praised for its modern use of machinery and progressive business model. As one of the largest employers in the area, it was credited with bringing prosperity to the town. The high grade of fine, white flour it produced became known as ‘Wagga Lily’ and demand for the product meant that it was not only distributed throughout Australia but also exported to the UK, Europe, including Russia, China, South Africa and Egypt.\n\nAlthough successful, the Murrumbidgee Flour Mill had to be closed temporarily on several occasions. In 1896 the mill was forced to close because of the high price of wheat and production. The impact of the new railway meant that freight costs for rural suppliers made them uncompetitive with their Sydney counterparts. Eight years later, the mill closed again due to the drought affecting the local supply of wheat. In 1904, the mill was forced to import grain from South Australia, USA, Canada and even Argentina. Then in 1929 a slump in the world wheat market meant that the mill had to cease production as it could neither store nor sell the processed flour, although its silos were full of grain. \n\nIn 1937 the company petitioned the Wagga Municipal Council seeking relief from the crippling high price of electricity. Then, in 1941, when all seemed to be going well and the product was in high demand from international buyers, a shipping shortage in Sydney once again forced a temporary closure.\n\nThe plant breeder and agronomist William James Farrer played a seminal role in the success of the wheat industry in the Wagga district and in fact, all of Australia. Conducting scientific experiments in cross-breeding on his farm “Lambrigg” near Queenbeyan, and in Wagga with Nathan Cobb, Farrer determined to produce a strain of wheat that would be better suited to the Australian conditions.  In 1901 he released the “Federation” strain of wheat grain.\n\nFarmers in the district were initially reluctant to take up the grain, preferring a strain called Purple Straw for flour milling.  For those who did choose to try the new grain, there was some criticism in the local press when it was felt that the product had deteriorated after several years. Farrer entered the debate suggesting that it was a lack of nitrogen in the soil that was affecting growth. However, he went on to produce another version of the wheat grain called “Hard Federation” which was found to be more suited to the Wagga district.	"The plant breeder and agronomist William James Farrer played a seminal role in the success of the wheat industry in the Wagga district and in fact, all of Australia."	1890-01-01	\N
84	 Star-crossed lovers of the southern skies	The tragic Wiradjuri love story of Pomingalarna and Gobbagumbalin long predates Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. Doomed to be separated for eternity, their names live on in the Wagga and Riverina districts.\n	The Pomingalarna reserve lies at the most western point of the Wiradjuri Walking Track. This is a thirty-kilometre track, which encircles the city centre of Wagga Wagga and follows the Murrumbidgee River through the Wiradjuri Reserve.  \n\nPomingalarna Reserve is not on the river but is an attractive recreational park and is particularly popular with mountain bike riders and horse riders, offering a variety of terrains and native vegetation. The story of Pomingalarna and Gobbagumbalin takes place on the banks of the nearby Murrumbidgee River.\n\nThe story goes that many years ago, there were two local tribes of Wiradjuri people living on either side of the Murrumbidgee River. The groups were generally peaceful but each had strict tribal laws, which were enforced with vigilance.\n\nOne day, a young man named Gobbagumbalin, the son of one of the elders, saw a beautiful young girl, Pomingalarna, who came from the neighbouring tribe.  Gobbagumbalin fell deeply in love with her and resolved to make her his wife.  However, the girl had been promised to a warrior from her own group.\n\nThe two met secretly for a while but when they were discovered, the council of elders warned the young man that he was violating tribal law and would be punished if he continued to see the girl. However, the passionate young lovers refused to abide by their laws and resolved to elope, knowing that they would be outcasts.\n\nThey decided that Gobbagumbalin should swim across the river at a spot where Pomingalarna would wait for him. They would then recross the stream together and run far away to the ranges. On the appointed night the young man slipped into the water and swam silently to his lover. They set off together for the far shore but as they reached the middle of the stream they were attacked from both sides by a hail of spears, which fell hissing into the water around them. \n\nBoth Pomingalarna and Gobbagumbalin were killed, sinking together beneath the dark water. Today, especially on a hot summer night, the frogs can still be heard mourning the sad fate of the young lovers. Those on one side of the Murrumbidgee cry ‘Gobbagumbalin’, while those on the opposite side sing ‘Pomingalarna’.	"Those on one side of the Murrumbidgee cry ‘Gobbagumbalin’, while those on the opposite side sing ‘Pomingalarna’."	\N	\N
93	For the love of gold! 	The Tilba Tilba District Cemetery was established at the turn of the 20th century and is located in an idyllic setting next to the ocean on what was Horrex Read’s property ‘Haxstead.’ Eleanor Bate, the 33 year old daughter of Tilba Tilba’s first resident Henry Bate, is the first recorded headstone, where there are around 100 graves belonging to the early European settler families, who came to the district to dairy farm and mine for gold.	Situated adjacent to the ocean, this beautiful isolated coastal site, with views to Mount Dromedary was not only the home, but also the final resting place for local mining enthusiast Horrex Read. Horrex was the original settler of the Haxstead property and lived there for 52 years.\n\nHorrex, who never married, was one of the earliest pioneers, arriving from Bega in 1871, he occupied the property until his death at the age of 87. He was an enthusiastic gold miner and loved the thrill of the chase. His love of the gold rush began in Bendigo, shortly after landing in Australia from England at the age of 14.\n\nIn 1879, Horrex and his gold mining partner Joseph Latimer, reach the heady heights of fame when their reef, named the South Star, was visited by a Sydney reporter. The author describes the sounds of reverberating blasts, where the industrious pair is tunnelling 75 metres into the mountain. The process is described as primitive, extremely tedious and inefficient! The reporter recommends that in order to reach the hidden wealth, a better system of management and substantial capital outlay will be required.\n\nA couple of years later, our reporter pays Latimer and Read another visit, where the couple are now operating a company, with ‘large results.’   The horse powered equipment known as an ‘arrastre’ for crushing up quartz, is to be shortly replaced with a battery and steam engine process, in order to increase productivity.\nFast forward a decade or so and Latimer and Read have sold their claim to a Mr Bailey, who is believed to have sold at least a portion of his lease to the Mount Dromedary Gold Mining Company. The Tilba contribution to the gold mining boom was short lived.

109	Tent Town trouble\n	By the 1920s, the Chinese opium dens of the 1870s and 80s that had sprung up near Hampden Bridge were gradually replaced with a shanty town known as Tent Town.	Houses there consisted of crude huts built with bush timber and clad with canvas wheat bags rubbed with cement, with floors of dirt and packing cases as furniture.\n\nIt was a place for the poor and unemployed. Residents could build their own hut or rent a tin one erected by 'landlord' Mr Neda Singh. A thriving business this may have been, but in 1925 Mr Singh landed himself in the Wagga Police Court for the second time and was fined £2 for having “a stable in Tent Town in a dirty condition.”\n\nThe prosecution was made by Mr Lewis—the same, hard-working municipal health inspector who investigated the Typhoid tea party.\n\nBut the Tent Town antics didn't stop there. Two years later Neda Singh was back in court, after he was assaulted by two men, Thynne and Holland, who owed him money. Reluctant to pay, they preferred to punch Singh in the face and knock him down. Even after a bystander intervened and said that it “was not fair to hit an old man like that” they punched and kicked him after which he spent three days in hospital. \n\nThe court found in favour of Singh and dismissed the defence evidence as spurious, despite Thynne and Holland presenting two witnesses who corroborated their story.\n\nDuring the Depression, the unemployed, the evicted and the working poor flocked to Tent Town. Several Council meetings called for its closure and for residents to be rehoused elsewhere as tension rose.\n\nDespite initial outrage by the Mayor, the Council responded to the housing crisis and voted to extend the reserve to the north side of the river and provided toileting for those camping at Pregan Parken Lagoon. They opened a camp at Willans Hill near Lake Albert for additional tent accommodation.\n\nThe ALP lobbied for an old hangar at the aerodrome to accommodate evicted families but the Council rejected the idea. Eventually, drill hall was provided by the Department of Defence on the condition that Council paid for sewerage and insurance. \n\nTent Town limped on for several decades. In 1948, there were still 25 people—19 children and six adults—living there.\n	"During the Depression, the unemployed, the evicted and the working poor flocked to Tent Town."	1900-01-01	\N
18	Bring on the Horses	Although the word ‘lancer’ is now mostly heard in relation to a car, its association with those going into battle on horseback and the long handled javelin as their weapon of choice, goes back to medieval times. While Australia’s Lancers no longer use horses or wield the heavy lance, they do have a long and continuing history. Based in Parramatta, they have made the colonial military barracks their home.	\nAs was so often the case with the first colonial buildings, the c1790 military barracks basically fell down. Reported as being riddled with damp, and collapse imminent, in 1818, Governor Macquarie gave orders for the construction of a new barracks carriage loop and parade ground to begin. These new premises were known as the Military Barracks and were to be the eventual home of the Lancers.\n\nThe barracks saw various British regiments reside there until the 1850s when, with the convict era over, troops were withdrawn and allowed to go home. Then, for the next 40 years or so, and still without a horse in sight, government offices and the police occupied the site. \n\nIt wasn’t until January 1885 when the Sydney Light Horse Volunteers were formed that the reign of the Lancers begins. The east wing building was demolished to provide space for the horse training ground, and the barracks become the hub from which the Lancers trained to fight in the Boer War. It was here they gained the first of their 31 battle honours, collecting still others at the WWI and WW2.\n\nMuch of this success can be attributed to ‘Fighting Charlie’ Cox. Having earned his stripes in England where Charles Frederick Cox had captained a Lancer attachment, when war broke out in South Africa in 1899, Cox—plumed with emu feather in his hat— readily volunteered his regiment.\n\nDespite reportedly being a vain and forceful man, history has regaled him well: “a man of the sword and the warhorse, of the night march and the attack at dawn …”. Cox’s inspired leadership of the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades continued into WWI where they saw extensive action in Gallipoli, Egypt, Palestine, and Syria.\n\nFighting Charlie’s personal photo albums and diaries are drawcards of the 6000 strong object collection held on site at Linden House Museum, one of the several buildings at Lancers Barracks.\n	"Despite reportedly being a vain and forceful man, history has regaled him well: “a man of the sword and the warhorse, of the night march and the attack at dawn …” "	1820-01-01	\N
29	Are We There Yet? The Indomitable Pioneer, Janet Templeton	Dreading the family vacation? Imagine you’ve packed the tent, packed the kids, packed the dog. A gruelling five-hour drive looms and you are beginning to doubt the wisdom of a whole week screen-free with no access to a decent coffee or a chemist.\n\nNow, imagine it’s 1830. You and the children are about to embark on a five- month journey by sea to the other side of the world. Chronic boredom and seasickness will be inevitable and you will never be coming home again.	In 1829, following the death of her husband (wealthy Glaswegian banker Andrew Templeton), Janet Templeton made the bold decision to emigrate to Van Diemen’s Land. Her plan was to accompany her relatives the Forlonges, and bring with her with a flock of the finest merino sheep so as to establish herself as a pastoralist. The sheep were purchased from the then Kingdom of Saxony (now a state in eastern Germany) and driven across Germany and Hamburg to arrive in England.  \n\nJanet’s sister-in-law, Eliza Forlong(e) would seem to have been another impressive Scotswoman, having facilitated her own son’s importation of Saxon sheep to Van Diemen’s Land that same year. It was Eliza who made several trips on foot through Saxony selecting sheep to bring to the “colonies”.\n\nIn 1830, Janet chartered a brig named ‘the Czar’ and set sail for the antipodes. She boarded the vessel with her eight children, seven Scottish servants and 63 Saxon merino sheep. The cargo also included six horses, furniture and agricultural equipment.\n\nJanet Templeton and her ‘flocks’ (of sheep, children and staff) initially settled in Tasmania, later moving to the Goulburn area. She purchased land in Parramatta in 1835 and Roseneath cottage was built by 1837 when her daughter Maria married her cousin, William Forlong(e), at the home.\n\nTempleton did not reside for long at Roseneath and the residence was let from 1843. In 2015, as the home was being prepared for private sale, a treasure trove of children’s toys was found under the floorboards of the attic. Believed to be from around the 1850s, the little collection included small wooden animals, marbles and dominos as well as a number of peach seeds.\n\nJanet Templeton is credited with the introduction of merino sheep into Victoria. A granite memorial to both Janet Templeton and Eliza Forlong(e) stands in Euroa, in northeast Victoria. Fittingly, the memorial is in the shape of a wool bale and is close to the grave of Eliza.	"In 1830, Janet chartered a brig named ‘the Czar’ and set sail for the antipodes. She boarded the vessel with her eight children, seven Scottish servants and 63 Saxon merino sheep."	1837-01-01	\N
38	Walking Wiradjuri Country	Once upon a time, walking was the only way to go. To walk one’s country was to know one’s country.\n	The Wiradjuri people of the Wagga region knew their Country well. Unlike the early Europeans who were driven to survey, settle and privatise it, the Wiradjuri tended the land and conserved the resources within it. \n\nTheir ministrations to the land were recorded by the first explorers and expanded upon by Dame Mary Gilmore—poet, early feminist and long-time Labour advocate. \n\nGilmore, who grew up in the area and played with local Aboriginal children, wrote about the designation of animal sanctuaries to facilitate breeding. There was an emu sanctuary at Eunonyhareenyha in North Wagga and one at Parkan Pregan Lagoon for pelicans, swans and cranes. \n\nActive conservation also occurred along the rivers and billabongs. In secluded pools and handmade weirs, fish fry and fingerlings were nursed to maturity, and Sturt reports platypus in abundance along with shellfish, yabbies and crayfish. \n\nOut past the old Bomen Railway Station, about three kilometres north of the river is the Bomen Axe quarry. Rich in basalt, a stone used to make axe heads, hammers and spear tips, the area was used for mining and manufacture of tools. Archaeology has returned stone flakes, broken axe heads and interestingly, some of the tools communally used in manufacture such as anvils and hammer stones, underscoring the shared nature of Wiradjuri culture.\n\nThe quarry is part of the Bomen Industrial Estate, an apt setting, given the quarry was home to the area’s earliest industry. It’s an important part of Wiradjuri Country and functioned as lookout and meeting place. Located in low hills it connected the sacred site in The Rock Nature Reserve, a dedicated Aboriginal Place, with well-worn trade routes to the south-west. Today the quarry is zoned for public recreation. \n\nReports and oral histories also describe the agricultural pursuits of the Wiradjuri. They cleared the land using fire and nurtured selected fruit and berry species into production. Women harvested grass and fibres for weaving and collected and ground seeds for flour.\n\nToday contemporary artists celebrate Wiradjuri Country and describe their cultural practices in new ways. The Wagga Airport features etched glass panels depicting animal totems and the woven dilly bags and baskets used to collect and carry food as the traditional owners walked their Country. 	"It’s an important part of Wiradjuri Country and functioned as lookout and meeting place. Located in low hills it connected the sacred site in The Rock Nature Reserve, a dedicated Aboriginal Place, with well-worn trade routes to the south-west."	\N	\N
47	 We shall not be moved	Eight major floods were recorded in Wagga Wagga before the 1950s: 1844, 1852, 1853, 1870, 1891, 1900, 1925, and 1931. The early settlers were well aware that not enough water was worse than too much, so from 1890 they sought to control the mighty Murrumbidgee with levee banks.\n	\nThe Commissioner for Roads in Sydney sent an engineer to scope out the project. He said no dice and no dyke. Too expensive, too extensive. So regular inundation continued. Then after multiple floods in 1956, a 1 in 100 year-rated levee bank was finally built on the south side of the river to protect South Wagga Wagga and the central commercial town. \n\nIn 1974, as waters rose once again the townsfolk held their breath, but the banks withstood the flood though reinforcements were made over the next few years to bolster the weak spots.\n\nHowever, North Wagga remained unprotected except for a series of temporary levees scattered along the edge of the floodplain. Residents had petitioned Council for protection from regular flooding and as early as the 1930s Council was suggesting people relocate to higher ground. \n\nHowever, the locals would not be moved. Community action demanding levee protection, rezoning, and the lifting of development permissions—which had been slapped on local properties to deter investment in the area—was regular and persistent.\n\nIn the 1960s, the graffiti “We shall not be moved” appeared painted below “Welcome to North Wagga”—an indication of the level of public solidarity.\n\nWhile the chorus from the 1960s protest song made famous by The Seekers and Johnny Cash eventually reached the ears of the lawmakers, full flood protection continued to elude the northern residents. \n\nThe 1970s saw low banks constructed across the end of Kurrajong Lagoon and to the settler property of Eunonyhareenyha, but it was another 20 years before they were formalised to provide 1 in 20-year flood protection. \n\nFurther east, the temporary levee at Gumly Gumly was bolstered in 1992 to withstand a 1 in 10-year flood, and today the area still relies on an unlicensed bank running from North Wagga Wagga to Gobba Weir to hold water out of the northern floodplain.\n	"In the 1960s, the graffiti “We shall not be moved” appeared painted below “Welcome to North Wagga”—an indication of the level of public solidarity."	1956-01-01	\N
57	Cheese: Stop please!	The familiar catch-cry of the Australian bushrangers “Bail up”, meaning “Stop! Halt! Hands in the air!” filled many with fear, so dreaded was attack by the bad boy bandits of the 1860s and 70s. But the term “bail up” is also associated with cows and refers to the system of restraining a cow in a crush or bail for milking. \n	And in Bodalla, there’s evidence that more than 300 cows a day were “bailed up”. At Comerang Farm, the oldest cow bails in Australia—the remnants of which could be easily dismissed as just another dilapidated farming structure—once held firm the necks of 60 cows at a time in the 24-bail cow stalls.  \n\nHome to the early dairy industry, Comerang Farm was one of three farms that formed the Bodalla Estate under the management of Thomas Sutcliffe Mort. As the central point in his triad of farms, which included Riverview and the 13,000-acre Tuross River property, Boat-alley (which gave rise to the name “Bodalla”), Comerang Farm was pivotal in the operation of the Estate. \n\nMort, one of NSW’s early industrialists, possessed business acumen, vision and a certain investment mojo. He pioneered refrigerated meat transport, funding the first shipping ice-factory in Sydney; established the first public wool sales; championed the Sydney to Parramatta railway; and was a founding partner in Australian Mutual Providential Society (AMP). He is remembered through Goldsborough and Mort Co., a name still emblazoned on the old Darling Harbour wool store—now luxury apartments—and by Mort’s Dock in Balmain.\n\nIn Bodalla, the mover and shaker applied his industrial clout to his dairy estate. Removing the beef cattle from his land, he cleared pastures, drained river swamps, erected fences, sowed imported grasses, and built milking sheds and cheese and butter-making equipment. By using specialised labour, first-class facilities, efficient stock control, careful stock-breeding programs and controlled blending of milk from different breeds and farms he engineered high-quality products, and Bodalla Cheese became a household name.\n\nAfter Mort died in 1878, his trustees took over the business, constructing a horse tramway (link to story for tramway: Register item # 1550324) from near the Bodalla Post Office to the Narooma Wharf to convey the Estate’s milk, butter, cheese and bacon to post where it went by ship to Sydney. \nIn 1923 Bodalla Estate became a cooperative until 1987 when local farmers transferred their supply to Bega. More recently, the Bodalla Cheese has been "bailed-up" by Fonterra, a New Zealand-owned company, who retain control of the brand, a situation which doesn't please some of the locals.	"In Bodalla, the mover and shaker applied his industrial clout to his dairy estate. Removing the beef cattle from his land, he cleared pastures, drained river swamps, erected fences, sowed imported grasses, and built milking sheds and cheese and butter-making equipment."	\N	\N
60	The compassion of Conjura	Sometimes a name just sticks. Take ‘House of Compassion’ for example. That’s the name given to the turn of the century private residence, Conjura, once operated by the Sisters of Compassion as Wagga’s first nursing home. \n	\nThe Sisters’ story is one of religious mission. They arrived in Australia from New Zealand where the Daughters of Our Lady of Compassion order was founded in 1892, in the Marist tradition. The Sisters established a House of Compassion in Broken Hill in 1941 and busied themselves by nursing the sick and dying, running orphanages and training nurses.\n\nThe Sisters spent 22 years (1952 to 1974) at Conjura caring for 20 residents before moving to larger premises in Bardia Street. They now run The Forrest Centre.\n\nIn those 22 years, it’s likely that Conjura embraced them. Well-appointed with many rooms and several wings, the house sits sedately on its corner block. Accessed by three frontages including Womboy Lane, it would have accommodated the Sisters, their charges and requisite services commodiously. Ringed with verandahs positioned to capture winter sun or avoid the summer heat, Conjura appears as a serene and demure house with spaces for contemplation and protection.\n\nThis so-called compassionate house began its life as a ‘town house’ for Alick Smith of Kyeamba Station, owner of a large agricultural property south-east of Wagga. He chose to build among respectable friends who had nabbed the top spots close to town and near the peaceful Wollundry Lagoon.\n\nSmith contracted Charles Hardy to build his pied-à-terre, who already had an impressive list of buildings to his name. He had built the Council Chambers on the corner of Bayliss and Morrow Streets, St John’s Anglican Church and St Michael's Cathedral, and in Fitzmaurice Street, the Courthouse, the Commercial Bank (now NAB) and the Old Union Bank Building.\n\nMuch interested in civic affairs, the Hardy family legacy in Wagga is a significant one. He held the office of alderman and had a stint as Mayor in 1902-1903. Building to high standards, Hardy was both thoughtful to Wagga’s architectural heritage and sympathetic of a classical aesthetic. \n\nPerhaps then, a passionate man built the House of Compassion.\n	"Perhaps then, a passionate man built the House of Compassion."	1910-01-01	\N
70	House of atonement	This modest structure from the 1890s is a good example of a government funded public-works project during an economic slump. On the heels of a gold rush and a property boom, the collapse of the economy in 1892 was particularly harsh in NSW. The government of the day responded with an unprecedented building spree that gave Nelligen a new courthouse.	At the time, Nelligen had a stable population of about 500 people operating as the port for goods and transport up the Clyde River. Some gold diggings continued in the district but nothing like the heady days of the Araluen gold rush of the 1860s. Bushrangers were no longer a threat and life was relatively peaceful.\n\nLocal builder John McDonald was employed to construct the courthouse to the design of the newly appointed government architect Walter Liberty Vernon and the building is a fine example of Vernon’s work before he established his signature Federation style. \n\nVernon was an English trained architect who favoured the Federation or Arts and Crafts movement—the Australian equivalent of the Edwardian style of architecture. He saw major city public buildings as ‘monuments to Art’ and examples are Central Railway Station, the Mitchell Library and the Art Gallery of NSW. \n\nSmaller scale buildings suitable to the character of their surrounds can be seen in post offices (Newtown and Paddington), police stations (Randwick and Darlinghurst), fire stations (Randwick and Pyrmont) and courthouses (Redfern and Bowral). There are more than 50 heritage listed public buildings from Walter Liberty Vernon’s time in office.\nVernon was also influential in the decision to build the nation’s capital on the site of Canberra and to have Walter Burley as town planner.\n\nAs time went by Nelligen’s population continued to dwindle. Batemans Bay, located on the Princes Highway, grew into the dominant town in the region and in 1940 the Nelligen Courthouse closed for business. \nAfter severe bushfires ravaged the region in 1939, Church of England parishioners were left to look for a new house of worship as they had lost their church, St Nicholas, to the fires. In the mid 1950s, the Courthouse became their new home, hence the cross that sits atop its perky front gable. \n	"Vernon was an English trained architect who favoured the Federation or Arts and Crafts movement—the Australian equivalent of the Edwardian style of architecture."	1893-01-01	\N
79	Scum - most wickedly admired!	The Catholic Churches followed Irish people to remote places such as Nelligen to try and maintain public morality through Christianity.  During this period, defiance of the ‘ruling’ class was taking place as the newly arriving free migrants rallied to get their share.  The new settlers believed that they were given no opportunity to purchase land and fed up with being treated like convicts, some took to bushranging to ensure justice.	By the time St Joseph’s Roman Catholic Church was built in 1896, the area had already undergone the treacherous reign of bushrangers for several decades. Bushranging was the worst manifestation of class struggle.  The new immigrants, who had long dreamt of a future of freedom and bounty on leaving Ireland, found themselves forced to provide labour for the gentry, imprisoned, poor and not leading the independent lives they had desired. \nAustralia’s most bitter and troublesome bushrangers were Thomas and John Clarke who began their days of crime stealing horses for ransom. They later went on to carry out an 18 month rampage of the Araluen goldfield areas, killing a police officer and committing 70 odd crimes, mostly robbery.\n\n4 ‘special police;’ Carroll, Phegan, Kennagh and McDonnell, were sent to the area to capture the brothers but were murdered, one with a bullet through the heart. Whilst their murders were credited to the Clarkes, the brothers were never charged for the crime.\nUp until the murders of the policeman, the pair had the sympathy of many and their organised bush telegraph system protected them. But by the time they were arrested they were no longer admired as heroes but deemed ‘wicked scum of the earth.’ \nA £1500 reward was offered, which finally resulted in their capture.  The success of their arrest was in large part due to a local Aboriginal tracker, Sir Watkin Wynne.  He noticed the fresh footmarks of two horses which led them to an isolated hut in the bush and after a lengthy shoot out, the Clarkes were forced to surrender. \nThe brothers were shackled overnight to a tree in Nelligen, while they awaited shipment to Batemans Bay and then on to Sydney for their trial. It is reported that their ‘insensible behaviour was due to the lack of clerical ministrations.’ \nVisit the bushranger’s tree in Nelligen today.  Sit down by the Clyde and imagine the brothers, tied to the tree, awaiting transportation to their trial and execution by hanging.\n	"Up until the murders of the policeman, the pair had the sympathy of many and their organised bush telegraph system protected them. But by the time they were arrested they were no longer admired as heroes but deemed ‘wicked scum of the earth.’"	1896-01-01	\N
96	Mel Gibson’s showbiz legacy launched in Tuross Heads! 	Built in 1870, with local stone on the high point of Tuross, Tuross House in Coral Crescent was the birthplace and home of the famous opera singer Eva Mylott.  Patrick, her father, on discovering his daughter’s rich contralto voice leased his farm to support her potential and foster her love of music.	Story\t\nHis support of her talent did not go unrewarded as a few years later Eva’s sweet clear voice drew record crowds in Sydney.  She was soon the protégé of Nellie Melba, the first Australian to achieve international acclaim as a classical musician. Melba encouraged Eva to continue her studies in Paris with Mathilde Marchesi, where she committed herself entirely to improving her technique.\n\nEva toured Britain, Europe, America and Canada for a number of years. On tour with the Russian Orchestra, she travelled 12,000 miles in 6 weeks and sang Handel’s Messiah 60 times! Not only did she tour relentlessly, she also had 3 tutors, one for the German classics, one for ballads and another for ensemble work - all while learning a variety of pieces in French, Russian, German and Italian!  \n\nThe Americans especially loved her, and while on tour in Texas, torrential flooding meant she had to perform for 2 days without food!  She was very in vogue as an entertainer in the New York homes of the rich and famous – at least with the private gigs, Eva would have bagged a meal!\n\nShe returned to Australia in 1912 and was welcomed like a royal, and besieged with flags, banners, bouquets and hundreds of people waiting at the harbour to greet her. On her arrival, she said her key to success was hard work, a good business sense and will to study. \n\nEva settled in America and married Hutton Gibson and had two children. She died at the age of 44, shortly after the birth of her second son Alexander. There is conflicting information about how she died; but whether it was a slip in the shower, throat cancer or post-natal complications it was a sad day for all those who knew her as the ‘Queen of Song.’ Her legacy in the arts and show business is continued through her grandson, the actor, Mel Gibson.\n	"She returned to Australia in 1912 and was welcomed like a royal, and besieged with flags, banners, bouquets and hundreds of people waiting at the harbour to greet her."	1870-01-01	\N
19	Pomp, Power and Profanity in the Park	Parramatta Park has been at the centre of command and ceremony since it was cleared by 100 convicts in 1790 for the first Governor Philip. But alongside the pomp and power the Park’s ‘Speakers Corner,’ was also the scene of profanity!  In 1871, Welsh-born William Lorando Jones’, ‘wickedly profane and evil’ voice landed him in court, as the last person to be prosecuted for blasphemy in NSW.	During the late nineteenth century Parramatta Park was a popular recreation ground for planned events, such as Sunday school picnics, gala days and carnivals. It was also a haven for the homeless and unplanned events that presented both the Rangers and Trustees with their fare share of ‘unseemly scenes.’  \n\nImpromptu soap box orators often bemused the crowds at the pavilion near the Rose Hill bowling greens, on topics such as the consumption of alcohol and religion, and it was the latter that landed the respectable Mr Jones in hot water.\n\n Jones was a professional photographer, architect, lecturer and inventor and was employed as a sculptor for the chief Justice of NSW, Sir James Martin, for his residence 'Clarens' at Rushcutters Bay.\n\nFrom his platform in Parramatta Park, Mr. Jones, a member of the Sydney Secular Society said that the Old Testament Bible, was not fit to be read by young ladies. He quoted the Bible chapter and verse to prove his point to the audience of some 200 people one of whom was the aspiring young politician, Ninian Melville, Junior who took Mr. Jones to court. \n\nThe case created a great deal of interest and the moment the doors to the court opened all spaces were filled. Jones was charged with ‘being a wicked and evil disposed person, disregarding the laws and religion of the colony, and wickedly and profanely devising and intending to bring the Christian religion into disbelief and contempt.’ \n\nJones was found guilty and the Judge remarked that he would make an example of Jones to prevent a repetition of such an offence, and sentenced him to two years imprisonment in Darlinghurst Gaol and a fine of 100 pounds.\nA public outcry over the sentence, including a petition of over 2000 signatures, resulted in the release of Mr. Jones four weeks later. \n\nTake a visit to the spot where Jones delivered his blasphemous speech.

28	Take Me to the River 	Today, a trip to Parramatta along the river is a 45-minute ferry ride. You’ll see the river at its best—picturesque views of historic sites punctuate the journey, and the mudflats and mangroves hint of a river returning to health after a century of industrial use.\n	However, the ebb of quiet tides obscures a darker history; one where psychiatric institutions, rehabilitation hospitals, prisons and orphanages were some of the most prominent residents of the riverbanks.\n\nAs the ferry pushes past Cockatoo Island is Callan Park Hospital for the Insane is glimpsed. Constructed between 1880 and 1884, it was the first purpose-built hospital “for moral therapy treatment” in Australia. \n\nThen to the right, on land now occupied by Gladesville Hospital was Tarban Creek Lunatic Asylum. Opened in 1837 and originally a Marist Brothers priory and farm, by 1890 it housed 1020 patients.\n\nWhere the river is still wide, the Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital Directly looks across to Kissing Point where James Squire brewed his famous beer. Considered modern in its day, renowned architect John Sulman built the hospital to reflect Florence Nightingale's 19th-century convalescent hospital designs of well-ventilated, sunny and windowed wards. Now part of Concord Repatriation Hospital, the hospital opened in 1883. The following year the adjacent Joanna Walker Memorial Children's Convalescent Hospital opened.\n\nBut they weren’t the only hospitals to be built in that neck of the woods. In the 1940s Yaralla—a large home built in 1851—became the Dame Eadith Walker Convalescent Hospital and dedicated to those recovering from “Sub-acute Diseases”. \n\nMoving steadily upstream and just as the river begins to narrow and quieten, Newington House is found. Built in 1830 and now part of the head office of Silverwater Correctional Centre, the site’s pre-1900 history involves both hospital and asylum, and later prison and reform school.\n\nJust before passing under James Ruse Drive bridge the remnants of a 1893 boatshed can be seen. With its toes barely in the river, this boatshed, its adjacent sandstone retaining walls, steps and water channels, were once the main entry to the Female Orphan School. \n\nToday they remind us of the girls’ short trip across a river to where religious instruction, heavily regulated days and with little by way of love and affection defined their lives. This piece of land, home to hundreds of destitute and abandoned girls from 1818-1850, like so many riverside properties, evolved into hospital and asylum to become the Parramatta Hospital for the Insane.\n\nBefore the river forks into Darling Mills Creek and Toongabbie Creek, lies the Cumberland Hospital precinct. This site saw the birth of four of Parramatta’s most significant sites: the Female Factory, the Roman Catholic Orphanage, the Parramatta Lunatic Asylum, and the notorious the Parramatta Girls Home, all of which were confined and defined, and one hopes in some way or another, calmed by the Parramatta River.\n	"This piece of land, home to hundreds of destitute and abandoned girls from 1818-1850, like so many riverside properties, evolved into hospital and asylum to become the Parramatta Hospital for the Insane."	1813-01-01	1940-01-01
41	Say Cheese	The area of Tilba on the south coast of NSW is focused around two heritage villages, Central Tilba and Tilba Tilba, which are only a short drive from each other and which have enjoyed heritage listing for their faithful restoration and maintenance of their C19th period features. Both villages are nestled at the base of the majestic Gulaga/Mount Dromedary. The Bate family was central to the development of the Tilba area although some rivalry existed between brothers Richard and Samuel.	The Yuin Aboriginal people were the original inhabitants of the land and the name Tilba Tilba is said to be a Thawa Aboriginal term for “many waters” Certainly the consistent water supply was a determining factor in the success of the dairy industry in the area and the establishment of the ABC Cheese Factory. Central Tilba has also proved to be the ideal scenic location for the lifestyle television series, River Cottage Australia, in which former chef, Paul West, showcases local produce and farming practices.\n \nThe ABC Cheese Factory in Central Tilba is reportedly the first co-operative cheese factory in NSW. The current building, replacing the original, was completed in 1925 and was in operation from 1891 until 2006. In 2012, the factory was bought by two dairy farmers, Erica and Nic Dibden, who are now running a thriving boutique cheese and dairy products business and local tourist attraction using the rich, creamy milk from their own Jersey cows.\n\nThe first dairy cows arrived in Australia with the First Fleet in 1788. Two bulls and seven cows were transported from England by sea. Unfortunately, housing the animals in the new colony of New South Wales without adequate fencing proved to be a challenge and the small herd escaped into the bush not long after their arrival. These hardy beasts thrived in their new environment and after six years they had become a herd of 61.\n\nThe picturesque south coast of NSW, with its rich volcanic soils and generally decent rainfall was an ideal location for dairy farming. However, the mountainous, rocky terrain, difficult access to arable land as well as the limited transport options hampered early farming enterprises around Tilba. Before dairy products were processed locally, milk was sent to Sydney by boat from one of the small nearby ports of Bermagui and Narooma.\n\nRichard Bate established the ABC Cheese Factory on his property, which included Tilba Tilba, in 1891. However, his brother Samuel established his own village of Central Tilba right next door to the factory. In the 1890s, the gold rush bought many hopeful prospectors to the area and both villages prospered and fought for the right to secure the official Tilba post-office. When the gold rush ended in 1906, only one town could support a post office and the prize went to Central Tilba. The assignment of the cheese factory’s address to the village of Central Tilba rather than Tilba Tilba must have surely riled its founder, Richard Bate.\n	"Richard Bate established the ABC Cheese Factory on his property, which included Tilba Tilba, in 1891.

49	Show Me the Money!	The establishment of the Bank of NSW in Moruya, in 1873, was indicative of the town’s increasing growth and prosperity in the wake of the discovery of gold in Araluen in the 1850s and at Gulph Creek in the 1860s. Initially premises for the business were leased but during a period of major commercial expansion in the town a new building was constructed for the bank.	The Bank of New South Wales was Australia’s first and oldest bank. It was established in 1817, first operating from a tent in Sydney Town. Back then there was no stable monetary system in the colony and traders used rum, promissory notes, foreign coins and barter as currency. Disparagingly referred to as the ‘convict’s bank’, the institution got off to a shaky start when, in 1821, it was discovered that the Chief Cashier had stolen half of its capital, none of which was ever recovered. However, it survived this setback and the Depression of the 1840s and expanded rapidly as a direct result of the “gold fever” gripping the country from 1851. The bank set up gold-buying agents for every new diggings in nearby country towns, responding to the needs of both miners and merchants. By 1861 it had grown from a single office in Sydney to 37 branches in Australia and even New Zealand.\n\nIn Moruya, in 1877, the Bank of NSW purchased land from the Council of Education, previously allocated for a school, for £500. The building erected on Vulcan Street was of an impressive, if not extravagant, Victorian Italianate design and included a manager’s residence. It was built from local granite obtained from Louttit’s quarry on the south side of the Moruya River and completed by mid 1883. It was renovated in 1890, 1923 and 1930 resulting in an eclectic combination of architectural details. The bank closed in 1943 and the building passed into private ownership.\n\nThe construction of the new bank and courthouse premises was welcomed by the town’s inhabitants and newspaper reports of the time reveal a deep pride in the perceived ‘coming-of-age’ of the town and in the use of local granite not only for these landmarks but also in the Bank of NSW headquarters in George St, Sydney and in the General Post-office (Martin Place)\n\nAlthough the gold rush had dwindled by the early 1900s, in 1902 representatives from the Jessop Bros. mine lodged a ‘cake of gold’ at the bank in Moruya weighing over 144 ounces: over 4.3 kilograms in today’s money!\n	"Although the gold rush had dwindled by the early 1900s, in 1902 representatives from the Jessop Bros. mine lodged a ‘cake of gold’ at the bank in Moruya weighing over 144 ounces: over 4.3 kilograms in today’s money!"	1883-01-01	\N
58	Stand and Deliver	The Constable Miles O’Grady Monument in Nerrigundah commemorates the 1866 murder of Constable O’Grady by the notorious Clarke gang of bushrangers. The sandstone obelisk that was commissioned by the NSW Government and erected in his honour in 1867 is thought to be the only such monument in Australia dedicated to a policeman. However, without diminishing his heroic legacy, it must be noted that the claim he fought the Clarke gang single-handedly is incorrect.	The small town of Nerrigundah was established as a gold mining town following the discovery of gold at nearby Gulph Creek in 1861. From 1865 the Clarke Brothers bushranger gang terrorised the southern goldfields of NSW unopposed. \n\nThe gold from Nerrigundah was reported to be the purist in the colony and the infamous gang robbed storekeepers, travellers, farmers, publicans and prospectors from all over the district at gunpoint. They ambushed gold shipments from Araluen and Nelligen and held up coaches on their way to Sydney through the Illawarra. \n\nOn the evening of Monday 9 April five of the bushrangers rode into Nerrigundah, then a sizeable town with a population of 1200. The gang went first to the Wallis Hotel where they robbed all those present at gunpoint. Two gang members then went across the road to the store of Mr Pollock, a prominent gold buyer, and demanded the keys to his safe. His wife was able to snatch the safe key from gang leader Thomas Clarke, and threw it out into the street where her bare-footed son, Young Pollock, hid them under his feet and was able to escape with them between his toes. \n\nTwo police constables were on duty that night and Constable Miles O’Grady, suffering from a high fever, left his sick bed to confront the bandits. With Constable Patrick Smythe, O’Grady entered the hotel and found gang members Patrick Connell and William Fletcher about to shoot the local butcher Robert Drew. A gunfight ensued and O’Grady shot and killed William Fletcher, the son of a well-to-do Bateman’s Bay farmer who had only joined the gang the day before. Hearing the gunfire the other bushrangers returned to the hotel and Constable O’Grady was shot by Thomas Clarke as he and Smythe were attempting to withdraw. O’Grady died almost immediately as the bullet lodged close to his heart.\n\nWhen the gang was eventually caught over a year later, they were shackled to the prison tree in Nelligen before being transported to Sydney and hanged. \n	"Hearing the gunfire the other bushrangers returned to the hotel and Constable O’Grady was shot by Thomas Clarke as he and Smythe were attempting to withdraw."	1867-01-01	\N
69	Reel Arthouse Cinema	The School of Arts Soldiers Memorial Hall was built in 1926 for dances and balls, flower shows, public meetings and as a place to remember those who served Australia in WWI. It had a library and reading room and was also used as a cinema and a live performances space. It is one of the few continuously running cinemas from that time.	As a cinema, the SoA has kept up with changing screen technology. From the early days of silent films, the talkies, followed by Cinemascope in the 1950s and currently able to screen in 3D, the SoA has readily adapted to audience expectations. The SoA is one of the few continuously running cinemas from that period in NSW and is a valuable piece of Australia’s cinema history.\nThe School of Arts (SoA) was designed by Dick O’Donnell from Sydney and constructed from materials sourced locally. Many of the craftsmen employed in its construction gave a discount on their work as they themselves were returned soldiers. \nThe School of Arts Movement, also known as the Mechanics’ Institute Movement, originated in Scotland in the 1830s. It was a time of great scientific discovery—Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution, the steam engine, and the industrial revolution were in full swing. The purpose of the institutes was to provide a better understanding of scientific developments. Largely run by volunteers and assisted with small government grants, they provided public lectures, libraries and reading rooms. \nBy the late 1800s institutes were commonplace throughout Sydney and NSW regional areas. As government grants dried up and local councils opened public libraries, and as professional adult education facilities began to appear such NSW Technical and Further Education (TAFE) and Workers Educational Association (WEA), the institutes became less focused on scientific learning and more on community interaction and social gatherings. Today, many remain as community meeting places and halls for hire.  \nNarooma Soldiers Memorial SoA now plays a site-specific role. The land can only be used for the arts in its broadest sense and community education. A not-for-profit community organisation owns land and assets and these are are held in trust for the Narooma community and managed on its behalf. It sits adjacent to Montague Arts and Craft Society (MACS) Cottage and the SoART Gallery.\n	"The School of Arts Movement, also known as the Mechanics’ Institute Movement, originated in Scotland in the 1830s.

80	Greeks bearing gifts	The Plaza Theatre was built in 1933 to replace The Strand Theatre that burnt down the year prior. Its distinctive architecture—not easy to place within the Australian vernacular—provides the biggest clue to the Theatre’s origins and hidden history.\n	The Plaza is built in the Spanish Mission style that derives from California. However, this wasn’t a direct import: its immigration into Australia was a complex one, mingled with the rise of the Temperance movement and new interest in family dining, our early love affair with Hollywood, and surprisingly, the Greek diaspora of the 1920s.\n\nAlready heavily influenced by time spent in America, Greek immigrants coming to Australia in the first part of the 20th century brought with them many wonderful things. They introduced milk bars, soda fountains and the original health shake—the milkshake—made with fruit, fresh eggs, whole milk and enjoyably, a shot of alcohol. \n\nThey were also directly involved in the development of early cinema. \n\nReady to mix old with new, traditional with modern, the Greeks readily hybridised cultures. Regional centres benefitted well, where the legacy of milk bars and seriously cool retro cinema buildings are still present today. \n\nKevin Cork, a rural cinema enthusiast and researcher, estimates that between 1915 and the early 1960s, Greek-Australians controlled 120 venues in 60 towns in NSW. Of those, they constructed 34—almost 30%. \n\nOne such man, Greek entrepreneur Jack Kouvelis, came to Australia in 1910 and with his brother bought up big in regional cinemas. Operating as JK Capitol, Kouvelis secured the rights to the Plaza Theatre during the Depression. In 1946, when he sold the company to Hoyts, his portfolio sported multiple cinemas in Young, Tamworth, Armidale, Wagga, and Inverell.\n\nKouvelis’s venture with the Plaza Theatre was his third investment in Wagga entertainment, after the Wonderland and the Capitol with its popular American style Candy Bar. All venues showed a mix of film, live theatre and performance and were used for war-effort fundraising and civic events.\n\nWith the advent of diversified cinema complexes in the 1980s, The Plaza Theatre was forced to seek other tenants. It has been an ice skating rink and is now home to Best & Less. This news would likely have both Jack Kouvelis and Charles Bohringer—the Plaza’s architect with over 200 theatres and cinemas in Australia and New Zealand to his name—choking on their malted milkshakes and spilling Jaffas down the aisle.\n\n	"Ready to mix old with new, traditional with modern, the Greeks readily hybridised cultures."	1915-01-01	\N
95	Captain Moonlite sets sail	Stories about crossing the notorious bar at Wagonga Inlet at Narooma are plentiful. Almost as plentiful as stories about bushrangers causing havoc in the 1860s and 1870s. So a story about bushranger Captain Moonlite sailing a boat across the dangerous sandbar is one worth reading!	To set the scene, it's important to understand the difficulties of getting people and supplies into and out of the small settlement of Wagonga Inlet that serviced the goldfields around Mt Dromedary. \n\nThe Illawarra Steam Navigation Company started a paddle steamer service into the Inlet in 1862 but ceased trading there after the Mynora was wrecked on the bar two years later. Their departure left the trade open for sailing vessels, although getting into the river was equally as hazardous for boats under sail and between 1860-1885 at least six sailing vessels were lost in attempting the crossing. \n\nEnter Andrew George Scott (aka Captain Moonlite). In 1870, Moonlite had fled from the scene of one of his crimes—a bank robbery in Egerton Victoria—and arrived in Sydney where he bought a boat. \n\nDespite having scant knowledge about things nautical, his confidence preceded him (as it always did) and sometime between sailing to and from New Caledonia, and serving time in Maitland goal, Scott offered his service as Captain of his boat The Comet to one William Hobbs.\n\nWilliam Hobbs and his family were relocating from Sydney to the Inlet to take possession of Tarralla Point, bought some years earlier where Hobbs had established a house and orchard.\n\nThe trip from Sydney took over two weeks on account of bad weather. In preparing to negotiate the sandbar, ‘Captain’ Scott locked everyone except William Hobbs into their cabins. Instructing Hobbs to steer the boat under his directions, Scott climbed the foremast to sight the passage, shouting commands back to Hobbs on deck. In this way and lurching from breaker to breaker, they entered the Inlet.\n\nHobbs recalled it as "a very anxious time … the Captain had never been there before, and we had to go broadside on to the rollers which several times threatened to capsize us”. \n\nEveryone seems to have disembarked safely, although The Comet could not get out of the Inlet for a month and Captain Scott’s return cargo of fruit and oysters had to be thrown overboard in the waiting.\n\nPerhaps, Scott should have stayed even longer at Narooma. That way he may have avoided trouble at Wantabadgery (link to Wagga Police Station Wantabadgery story) where things did not end well for him.\n	"Hobbs recalled it as "a very anxious time … the Captain had never been there before, and we had to go broadside on to the rollers which several times threatened to capsize us”."\n	1870-01-01	\N
104	Coming up smelling of roses? Not quite!\n	From the 1870s the construction of a waterworks for Wagga was discussed but the cost was considered to be prohibitive. By 1885 the Waterworks was finally established with a pumping station built by the river and a 900,000-gallon tank built on Willans Hill. However, there were constant complaints about the poor quality of the water. Dirty water and a foul smell plagued the town for some time. Today however, nothing could smell sweeter than the roses in the Victory Memorial Gardens.\n	In the early 1900s a well was sunk to try and obtain a cleaner water source but this scheme was not successful. Poor sanitation created a terrible stench in the town and was blamed for the great increase in infectious diseases, including typhoid fever, in the 1890s and early 1900s. Poor hygiene and a lack of knowledge about disease prevention exacerbated the situation. Before the twentieth century bathing was not considered necessary and even doctors did not necessarily wash their hands between patients.\n\nLetters were written to the local newspapers beseeching the Council to take action. In1880, before the waterworks were constructed, one exasperated commentator wrote:\n   *’After heavy rain falls the stench for which this town is winning an unenviable notoriety becomes almost unbearable’*\nHe pointed the finger squarely at the woefully inadequate drainage system of the town’s gaol and suggested that the “vagrant inmates” in that “pestilence breeding institution” should be forced to build a proper sewer. Meanwhile, residents were discouraged from using unsealed cesspits from which contaminants would leach into the soil or sewerage would simply spill over the ground and into the streets. In the 1890s a night-soil man was employed to remove waste from the residences. Yet the odour remained.\n\nIn 1900, some five years after the waterworks opened, waterlilies were planted in the Wollundry Lagoon in an ineffective effort to dispel the smell caused by the inadequate drainage and sewer systems. Of course, the rank waters still found their way into the subsoil and the Murrumbidgee River from which the town water was drawn.\n\nIn 1906 letters were again published in the Daily Advertiser complaining of the horrendous smell, drainage, water and sewer problems. In 1908 the Council approved a proper sewerage scheme and by 1914 most of the town’s main streets were connected and those on the outskirts of the town were included when the line was extended in the 1920s. There were upgrades also to the Waterworks with a third reservoir being added in 1929 and the provision of reticulated water. In 1938 was a water supply filtration plant was installed. \n\nAlthough the waterlilies may not have been a success, the Peace Roses in the Victory Memorial Gardens at the far end of the Wollundry Lagoon thrive in the rich, fertile soil and gently perfume the air.	"Of course, the rank waters still found their way into the subsoil and the Murrumbidgee River from which the town water was drawn."	1885-01-01	\N
21	Third Oldest Stone Bridge in NSW	It was with a stroke of luck that Major Thomas Mitchell, the Surveyor-General of NSW saw recent emigrant and stonemason David Lennox toiling away on a wall in Sydney with pick and chisel in hand. Forever on the lookout for experienced tradesmen to take on the construction of the much-needed network of roads, bridges, and drains, Mitchell had Lennox appointed as NSW Superintendent of Bridges for the Colony of NSW. \n	And it wasn’t a moment too soon. The river at Parramatta had been in need of a decent bridge for some time. The original footbridge near Pitt Street had washed away in a flood in 1785. Replaced in 1802 with a wooden bridge further downstream at Church Street, by the 1830s Governor Bourke was itching to get something more substantial in place and instructed Lennox to build “a handsome stone bridge at Parramatta without delay”.\n\nAnd handsome it certainly is. Conspicuous in its grace and repose, the single-span stone elliptical arch bridge quietly supports the busy Church Street thoroughfare today. Built with sandstone quarried from the Female Factory and spanning 23 metres; the bridge cost the foundling colony 1797 pounds. Governor Bourke laid the foundation stone on 23 November 1836 and by 1840, the bridge was in daily use. \n\nLike much of our built environment, the bridge has been modified to meet changing demands. In 1912, the western parapet was removed to provide a cantilevered walkway, and the bridge strengthened to take the weight of trams on the Parramatta-Castle Hill line. In 1934, the bridge was again widened, this time using reinforced concrete faced with sandstone. Several two-metre sections were cut out of the balustrade to accommodate stairs down to the riverbank. In 1961, a seven-metre section was removed in the southeast corner, and a concrete slab was constructed to link the wing wall with the David Jones store entrance, paid for by the already thriving retailer. \n\nAs the man of bridges, David Lennox earned his stripes. Demonstrating engineering talent and design prowess he has his name on two other NSW bridges. The Horseshoe Bridge, commonly known as Lennox Bridge in the Blue Mountains was built in 1833 and towers nine-metres above the water level, spanned by a single six-metre arch. Conrad Martens painted the bridge in celebration of the road across the Blue Mountains and an unknown artist also sketched its construction showing Lennox working with convicts with whom he is reported to have got on well.\n\nIn 1839 at Towrang in Goulburn, Lennox busied himself with a bridge and a series of six culverts or drains to usher water under the bridge. Adjacent are the remnants of the stockade, where convicts were housed while they toiled for the colony’s future of sandstone bridges.	"As the man of bridges, David Lennox earned his stripes. Demonstrating engineering talent and design prowess he has his name on two other NSW bridges."	1836-01-01	1839-01-01
26	What Lies Beneath... The House on a House on a House	The transportation of convicts to NSW was abolished by decree in May 1840 and this historically marks the end of the colonial period of settlement in Australia. 1840 also marks the end of colonial architecture and the beginning of the Victorian style. Perth House and Stables were built in 1841 for the pastoralist and politician, George Oakes. The site contains remnants of different phases of European settlement from the very early colonial period to the early Victorian.\n	By 1840 the population of NSW was rapidly expanding. Oakes was a prosperous but civic-minded politician and was instrumental is getting a water supply to Parramatta. Oakes rejoiced in the cessation of convict transportation to Australia.  In 1851 he became the member for Parramatta in the first Legislative Council of Parramatta.\n\nAs society changed so too did the architecture. Perth House stands today as a fine example of Victorian Georgian styled architecture. The single-storey stone house and stables were designed by colonial architect and pioneer builder, James Houison who also built the original portion of Parramatta Gaol, the Old Courthouse, St John’s Church and All Saints Church in Parramatta, as well as his own dwelling.  \n\nEarly maps of the Parramatta area suggest that Perth House was built upon the remains of an earlier, simple timber dwelling, Rose Cottage. Archaeological excavations in the area have further revealed that this cottage was most likely built upon the site of an earlier convict hut.  \n\nEarly colonial architecture was primitive and limited by the scarce materials available. A shortage of nails and the poor quality of spades and axes sent to the colony made construction difficult. The original convict hut underlying Perth House would have most likely been a “wattle and daub” dwelling, created by sinking posts into the ground and then weaving thin branches between the posts. Walls were “plastered” clay or mud. \n\nA convict brick-barrel drain lies only 200mm below the surface of the site extending under the driveway of Perth House. Another brick-barrel drain is located nearby at 126-138 George St and was the first archaeological site to be placed on public display in the Parramatta CBD. Both drains are cylindrical in design and built from sandstock bricks and lime mortar containing shell fragments. Lime from limestone was scarce until the mid C19th and prior to this oyster shells found in Aboriginal middens were burnt to produce the lime needed for cement mortar.

37	A site ascends into prominence	It’s unusual to witness a heritage site growing in relevance for a contemporary audience. The Native Institution is one such site, and contemporary artists are at its heart.\n	The Native Institution site is a small landholding of about 30 acres at the intersection of Rooty Hill Road and Richmond Road, just north-west of Blacktown. It pops its head into history via several interrelated stories. \n\nIt is located adjacent to the first land grant made to an Aboriginal person—strange when they owned the land in the first place, but nevertheless true. It was also home to Governor Macquarie’s school for Aboriginal children operating firstly in Parramatta and in Blacktown from 1823 to 1831. \n\nIt was the long-time home of Maria Lock (daughter of Yellomundee, Aboriginal elder of the Boorooberongal clan of the Dharug people), alumna and brilliant student of the Native Institution. Maria lived on the site until her death in 1876 when the land was divided between her nine children. Her story is remarkable. Maria was one of the first Aboriginal women to marry a white man, an event made even more unusual in that he, Robert Lock, was a convict and by law ‘assigned’ to his wife!\n\nToday the site continues to reverberate with its history. Collaboration between Blacktown Arts Centre, UrbanGrowth NSW and C3West, an initiative of the Museum of Contemporary Art, has seen Aboriginal artists make camp there. \n\nThese camps have seen the production of several site-specific art works, wrought from history and told by direct descendants. Leanne Tobin, one of Maria Lock's ancestors, explores the influence of religion on her family and the secret of her Aboriginal past. Karla Dickens looks at lost childhoods, and who, along with Brook Andrew, Jason King, and Dianne Usher continue to draw attention to the impact of colonisation on Australia’s First Peoples.\n\nThey have celebrated shared histories with the local community hosting a corroboree that included a smoking ceremony to purify the site, children's workshops, music, and entertainment. The artists have participated in several related exhibitions, and much of their continuing work addresses the desire to permanently secure the site under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983.\n\nThe Native Institution site despite an almost complete absence of built heritage is amazingly alive. The Institution building was destroyed by fire in 1924 and except for some scattered remnants of early drainage, the site is vacant. As such, it's a perfect place for a corroboree.	"Today the site continues to reverberate with its history. "	1822-01-01	\N
44	Paddle your own canoe	The Aboriginal Canoe Tree is thought to be around two hundred years old and stands in the NSW south coast town of Broulee.  The tree, a mature Eucalyptus, is distinguished by the large elliptical shaped scar on its trunk indicating the earlier removal of its bark by the indigenous Yuin people for the purpose of building a canoe.  Markings on the tree suggest that it was cut using a stone axe.	Canoes were traditionally constructed from a single sheet of bark that was softened and melded into shape over a fire.  The bark was then folded and tied at both ends with a plant-fibre string and used for both hunting and transport.\n\nEven today, especially since the prohibition of trawling and the establishment of the Bateman’s Marine Park in 2006, there is an abundance and diversity of sea-life and birdlife in the Eurobodalla area.  Bream, whiting, mulloway and flathead can be found in the estuaries and on the reefs and beaches there are salmon, tailor, kingfish and snapper.  \n\nBefore European settlement the Bugelli-Manji group of the Yuin community lived in the Broulee area and surrounds for thousands of years.  They hunted and fished using the canoes. The women would sit in the canoes using hooks and lines whilst the men stood to throw spears.  They were also known to have kept a small fire burning in the canoe on a bed of seaweed or clay, not only for warmth but to allow them to cook their catch. The Yuin would also hunt the passing Humpback and Minke whales and traded local produce and sea salt with other communities further from the coast.  Nearby Wallaga Lake and Pambula River boast the largest Aboriginal shell middens found in Australia.\nFor more on shell middens click here (insert link below)\n(http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nswcultureheritage/ShellMiddens.htm)\n\nThere are many instances of the indigenous people helping the European settlers. The original settlement at Broulee was dependent on supplies being shipped from Sydney but this service was not always reliable. On several occasions during the 1930s the settlers were saved from starvation by the Yuin people who provided them with seafood.  \n\nIn 1841 the schooner Rover became shipwrecked off Broulee.  Crew members were rescued by a group of Yuin men who formed a human chain through the surf to bring survivors to shore. A report in the Sydney Gazette noted: \n‘As the men dropped from her [the Rover] their only chance was to get washed in by the surf within reach of the blacks, who were doing their utmost to save as many as possible, for which they merit great praise’.  In appreciation Captain William Oldrey presented every member of the tribe with a commemorative brass plate featuring an etching of the ship and an Aboriginal figure.\n	"The original settlement at Broulee was dependent on supplies being shipped from Sydney but this service was not always reliable. On several occasions during the 1930s the settlers were saved from starvation by the Yuin people who provided them with seafood."	1800-01-01	\N
50	The Squatters Joy	The Bates General Store in Central Tilba was built in 1895 as a butcher shop and residence.  Named after the Bate family who were the original settlers in the area, it has served as the premises for many businesses in the dairy farming region.	Henry John Bate, son of Richard M Bate, the founder of Tilba Tilba, used the premises to establish the area’s first Ford car dealership. As the sole distributor for Eurobodalla, by 1922 Bates had sold 29 cars and five one-ton trucks to the farmers and residents of the district. \n\nThe Model T Ford arrived in Australia in 1908 in kit form, to be assembled by local dealers. The car was dubbed the “Squatter’s Joy” as it was popular with farmers for its lightweight but robust design, allowing it to negotiate the rough bush tracks, clearing stumps and able to go through water. It was also popular for the relative ease with which it could be righted if it happened to turn over in a ditch. It was not until 1925 that the Ford Motor Company of Australia was established.\n\nIn addition to assembling the cars, local dealers were responsible for teaching the buyers how to drive. According to motoring writer Pedr Davis, farmers were particularly poor pupils as they expected a car to behave like a horse – “to stay on a course when directed and to steer automatically around any obstacles in its path.”\n\nBate offered a free maintenance service to the owners of all new Fords, engaging the services of Mr E. Milliner of the Tilba garage. \n\nThose who purchased a car would often find themselves ferrying supplies and residents to nearby villages and sporting events and would advertise their intended journeys in the Cobargo Chronicle. In 1922 Henry Bate, along with three other local Ford owners decided to treat the Tilba school children to an excursion to the ocean beach at Wallaga Lake to celebrate Empire Day. Several drivers had to make four trips ferrying the children but the day was a huge success and became a local tradition.\n\nOver the years the store had several owners. The Bate family actually purchased the store in 1980. Even then, the old store still had its original fittings including the shelving and counters and some of the original signage advertising the store’s wares including drapery, ironmongery, millinery and medicines.\n\nRead more about Bates General Store here (insert link to Bates General Store_AD_story #1_)\n	 "According to motoring writer Pedr Davis, farmers were particularly poor pupils as they expected a car to behave like a horse – “to stay on a course when directed and to steer automatically around any obstacles in its path.”"\n	1895-01-01	\N
64	The Sweet Taste of Country Life	It’s hard to imagine a time when the soft drink market was not dominated by a handful of players. But in colonial times, non-alcoholic drinks were produced from all corners of NSW by small local concerns. With good agricultural land producing high yield citrus crops but without the means to transport the fresh fruit to market, cordial manufacture provided a perfect business opportunity.  	The old Kildare Hotel is a good example of this type of venture. Originally built in 1866 as a hotel for travellers it was subsequently used as a cordial factory. The first proprietors were the Nelson family who then passed the business on to Jack Benson. It is unclear why Jack Benson closed the Kildare as a cordial business, possibly because of stiff competition from William Pollock opening his own cordial factory in 1886. \n\nPollock moved to Moruya from Brundee and came from a successful cordial manufacturing family that had similar enterprises in Nowra, Bellingen, Fernmount and Woodburn. The diverse range of cordial products available from the Pollock Brothers at the time included lemon syrup, lime juice cordial, raspberry syrup, ginger wine, orange bitters, hop bitters and sarsaparilla to name a few.\n\nBy 1890, it is estimated that Moruya had a population of one thousand people. It was noted for its “Irishness”. Half the population were Catholic as compared to a quarter for the rest of the colony. For immigrants coming from the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic, citrus fruits were luxury items. With little maintenance required, orange and lemon orchards were relatively simple and profitable to run. \n\nThe proliferation of temperance unions also helped increase cordial sales. Many prominent women gave voice to their concerns associated with the excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages. Temperance unions were conservative by nature but also advocated for the rights of women to vote in general elections and to be more actively engaged in public life.   \n\nAfter its time as a cordial factory, the Kildare Hotel underwent a variety of further uses. It was used as a hairdressing salon before becoming a surgery and residence for a number of doctors. When the last doctor moved out, the building was used as a private residence. It remains so today.\n	"For immigrants coming from the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic, citrus fruits were luxury items. With little maintenance required, orange and lemon orchards were relatively simple and profitable to run."	\N	\N
73	Bold men and boats	Despite early gold discoveries and a thriving timber industry operating by the 1880s, Narooma was not officially recognised as a port. Requests for dredgers to control of the ever-shifting sands at the river mouth and for a pilot to guide ship entries and exits fell on deaf ears. Save for being supplied with a lifeboat; the locals took it upon themselves to take up the slack.	Operating as informal ship pilots, sawmiller George Fuller and pioneer Captain Canty teamed up to both escort boats across the bar and sound the depth of water for ships informing them of where the hazards lay. \n\nIn May 1891, the newspaper gives this report:\n\n“The new lifeboat at Narooma was brought into requisition on Tuesday. The schooner Sarah Beattie was becalmed outside, and the floodtide ceased to run. Mr Fuller with a volunteer crew, took the boat on the bar, and brought the schooner in safe.”\n\nThis sort of do-it-yourself activity would be unheard of in today’s highly regulated world. Not only would it raise the ire of unionists and hard-hatted workplace safety officials, but likely attract penalties and court injunctions as the juggernaut of bureaucracy called for a multitude of licences and insurances. \n\nBut for the men of the gold rush era, opportunity of any sort was something that should not be passed up. Around the Inlet, those up for a challenge pounced on vessels wrecked on the bar, hauling them from sandy graveyards, hoisting them upon slipways for repair and repurposing.\n\nAccording to historian Laurelle Pacey, many a business ‘acquired’ a boat in this way. Edmund Coman bought the Belinda after it foundered with a load of timber. Fuller himself took on the Sarah Beattie after she was wrecked on the bar, despite his earlier efforts in liberating her from a state of becalm. He repaired her, and in the absence of a viable steamer service in and out of the Inlet, he and others operated this flotilla of salvaged ships to secure passage for their products to Sydney.\n\nIn turn, a home-grown shipbuilding industry was born. By the early 1900s, Narooma had at least four “good-sized” shipyards, the largest being the Clyde Sawmilling & Shipping Company. The Wee Clyde was their first project and when launched in 1909 amidst much fanfare, an onlooker said the ship “slid from her stays onto the waters of the river which she rode like the proverbial duck”.\n	"By the early 1900s, Narooma had at least four “good-sized” shipyards, the largest being the Clyde Sawmilling & Shipping Company."	\N	\N
81	Deep in the Hood doing Good!	The convent in Moruya was established by the Good Samaritan Sisters in order to widen their scope of work from caring for needy women to educating women. The Sisters brought Catholic Education to Moruya and educated girls from outlying farming districts, some of whom boarded at the convent. The Sisters could easily be viewed today as early feminists, seeking to establish opportunities for women in education and employment.	St. Mary’s Convent on its opening in 1927 was dedicated to the memory of Archdeacon Phillip Cassidy, who for over 32 years had worked as a parish priest in Moruya. Phillip was well known in the district for his work with the indigenous people of the area, the Yuin (Djuwin) tribe. There are recorded outbreaks of yellow fever and extensive Aboriginal burials when Father Cassidy was working in the area, with accounts of him ‘preparing a poor Aboriginal for eternity.’ \nHis district was an extensive one and to reach the outlying parts across the network of bridle tracks would have required excellent equestrian skills.  It is reported that Cassidy was able to spend days in the saddle riding deep into the bush from Nelligen to Narooma. \nPerhaps it was Cassidy, who wrote to the decision makers in Sydney, under the advice of Mother Basil, to recommend that catholic education in Moruya continue, thereby securing the future of the convent. \nAcross the road from the Convent was the Clubhouse Hotel owned and run in the early 1900’s by Thomas and Mary Kilkelly.  The Kilkelly’s had 7 daughters all of whom were educated by the Sisters where they learnt French, elocution, painting and music.  The school had good reputation for producing accomplished and employable women, during a time when women in the workplace would have been a novelty.\nIn 1906, the Kilkelly family was struck by a devastating accident when Thomas was thrown under the wheels of his horse-drawn carriage, and suffered severe brain damage, from which he never recovered. The family were supported by the Sisters, who also taught them worthwhile skills to gain employment, so that they would once again achieve their independence. \nVisit the Convent today and imagine yourself on horseback setting out into the bush to welcome the pioneering settlers to their new home, you really would be going deep into the hood to do good!  \n	"The school had good reputation for producing accomplished and employable women, during a time when women in the workplace would have been a novelty."\n	1927-01-01	\N
90	Place of Many Crows and Budgie Smugglers	The Wiradjuri Walking Track is a thirty-kilometre trail around the city of Wagga Wagga, which follows the curves of the Murrumbidgee River. The famous Wagga Wagga Beach is located on the riverbank alongside the walking track. Long favoured by locals as a place to escape the summer heat, Wagga Wagga Beach even had its own life saving club.\n	The Wagga Beach Life Saving Club (WBLSC) was officially founded in July 1927. It had been operating unofficially since the early 1920s but, in 1927, it was joined by The Badgers, a social club of footballers that enjoyed swimming as a regular activity. The Club patrolled the beach for almost forty years and was proud of its record that no one had drowned whilst the patrolmen were on duty. From the 1950s, the Club found it increasingly difficult to attract new members and it was disbanded in 1971. During the Second World War, when many of the male lifesavers were absent, a Women’s Beach Life Saving Club was formed.\n\nWagga Wagga Beach was used for general recreation, swimming lessons for the town’s school children and beach carnivals. The local newspaper, *The Daily Advertiser*, often featured stories of successful rescues by the brave lifesavers at Wagga Wagga Beach. The lifesavers seemed to patrol the beach at all hours. In 1932 two girls got into trouble when swimming at night, one at 7 o’clock and the other at 8.30pm. Both were plucked from the water and the council was advised to install a light to make night swimming safer. \n\nIn 1935 a fourteen-year-old girl and her young three-year-old brother both nearly drowned on a family outing. Both were pulled from the water unconscious, the boy having been submerged for almost ten minutes, but after twenty-five minutes of ‘restorative treatment’ both survived. What is remarkable is that the most common resuscitation technique of the time was the administration of CO2, then believed to stimulate deep breathing. Whilst carbon dioxide can produce rapid breathing and an increased heart rate, the correlative restriction of oxygen can cause convulsions, coma and death.\n\nIn 1945, a fourteen year-old girl, Nola Stearman, was rescued by one of the founding members of the Women’s Beach Lifesaving Club, Mrs Schrouder. The girl was transported to the Wagga Base Hospital where the Iron Lung machine was on standby. She suffered severe shock but survived. The valiant Mrs Schrouder, who was commended for her intervention, was also a member of the Women’s Australian National Service chapter in Wagga (WANS) and was attached to the Wagga Fire Brigade.\n\nA small collection of memorabilia from the Wagga Beach Life Saving Club can be found at the Museum of the Riverina.\n	"What is remarkable is that the most common resuscitation technique of the time was the administration of CO2, then believed to stimulate deep breathing."	\N	\N
103	Wagga Lily warmth\n	The history of the Riverina’s rise to agricultural powerhouse in which the Murrumbidgee Milling Company played a significant role is well documented. Today the redeveloped Mill wears the mantle of an ‘executive residence’, but its presence on the site then and now, obscures another product derived from the mill—the unique Wagga rug.\n	By the 1860s, there were several flour mills in Wagga as well as one in North Wagga—established there to avoid paying the exorbitant bridge toll.\n\nIn 1890 in a bid to prevent Henry Hayes, the largest mill owner, from monopolising production, other mill owners banded together to form the Murrumbidgee Cooperative Milling Company. They bought Hayes out and commenced milling in Edward Street (now the Sturt Highway); a location that was easy to access and close to the railway. \n\nProduction was cranked up and the mill’s main product, ‘Wagga Lily’ flour, became an international export reaching as far as Europe, Egypt and South Africa. In the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition, Wagga Lily won a gold medal. \n\nUnlike other agricultural products from the region such as chaff and corn, Wagga Lily was packed into high-quality calico bags rather than hessian sacks. In an era where ‘waste not, want not’ was the mantra, the empty bags were saved and sewn together into a type of doona or comforter called a “Wagga rug”. \n\nThey provided more warmth than a single layer blanket, and in the tradition of quilting, old clothing or scraps of fabric were sewn together to form the upside or the front of the rug. The outer layer, or back of the rug was made using the flour bags. Between the back and the decorative front, pieces of fleece, picked cotton, or feathers were sometimes inserted for extra warmth. \n\nMale itinerant workers often made their own Wagga rugs. Women joined in; wives made them for their husbands, mothers for their sons, and the practice became a blend of creativity, resourcefulness and craft. \n\nDuring the hardship of the 1920s and the Depression years, Wagga rugs became a ‘must-have’ item. They were used by all manner of people; those sleeping rough, agricultural workers, rabbiters, and timber workers. \n\nWagga rugs are now prized museum items and embody social history, agricultural history, and local history. The Museum of the Riverina has several in their collection including one featuring a complete man’s vest sewn flat still with buttonholes and label in place. \n	"During the Depression years, Wagga rugs became a ‘must-have’ item. They were used by all manner of people; those sleeping rough, agricultural workers, rabbiters, and timber workers."	\N	\N
22	Oldest Church Site and Continuous Place of Christian Worship in Australia	When in 1798 the Reverend Samuel Marsden held the first Christian service in a makeshift wooden hut in Parramatta, only 12 worshippers attended. Despite this understated beginning, St John’s Cathedral has been at the heart of Parramatta’s colonial history, with its cast of colourful administrators, reverends and entrepreneurs, and the push and pull between social reform and colonial expansion. \n	In 1802 Governor King officially proclaimed the first two parishes in the NSW colony—St John’s Parramatta and St Phillip’s Sydney—formally recognising the Church of England as the religious authority. His choice of location was prime and the marketplace and colonial town square, now Centennial Square, spanned out around it.\n\nSt John’s transition from makeshift hut to its 1803 official stuccoed brick building in Church Street to fully-fledged Cathedral in 2011 was a difficult one. Records indicate numerous problems over time: a collapsed vestry, a repeatedly leaking roof, unstable foundations due to drainage issues and shingles falling from the two towers paid for by Elizabeth and Lachlan Macquarie’s personal funds. \n\nToday these towers are considered the oldest remaining part of any Anglican church in Australia. The north tower houses the 1821 Thwaites and Reed of London clock, a singular reminder of the importance of synchronising the lives of convicts and parishioners alike, Like the clock at Hyde Park Barracks in Sydney, the Parramatta clock is one of the oldest functioning timepieces in Australia and still requires manual winding. \n\nBut for some, the church as a theatre for convict reform and Aboriginal education tells a more interesting story; commemorated in the Cathedral in the stained glass windows and memorial tablets.\n\nThe Reverend Samuel Marsden takes centre stage. First Rector of St John’s, senior chaplain to the colony and early resident of Parramatta, history remembers Marsden as a mean-spirited man on several counts. His reputation as a cruel magistrate proceeded him—it was common for government officials and those with important jobs to act as judiciary in the early colony—and his dislike of Macquarie’s liberation policies for convicts was public knowledge. He is said to have neglected ministry for those in the Female Factory and focused disproportionately on amassing his personal wealth. \n\nGovernor Macquarie also features. Locked in a bitter battle with Marsden, in 1814, he initiated an annual feast in the marketplace at the rear of St John’s, to promote friendly relations with the local Burramatta Aboriginal people. The celebration marked the beginnings of the Black Native Institution, Macquarie’s school for Aboriginal children. Located on church land to the northeast of St John’s the school taught reading, writing and religious study, training in manual labour for the boys and needlework for the girls. \n\nIn 1823, a large Native Institution moved to Rooty Hill and became known as the Black Town Native Institution giving rise to the modern suburb of Blacktown. \nNo longer accessed from Church Street, visitors can enter St Johns from Centennial Square. The grounds were opened to the public in 1953 and feature English Oaks, Jacarandas and a mature Norfolk Island hibiscus. Extensive church records from 1789 are kept on-site as is a 1599 Geneva Bible. Today St John's is an active church and reflects Parramatta’s rich cultural diversity and conducts services in English, Mandarin, Cantonese and Farsi.\n	"But for some, the church as a theatre for convict reform and Aboriginal education tells a more interesting story."	1802-01-01	\N
32	Agricultural Experiment, a Convict’s Test of Character or Australia’s Oldest House?	When Governor Phillip threw down the gauntlet to convict James Ruse at his request for land to farm, it was ‘game on’ to test the colony’s agricultural future.	\nWithin months of arriving in NSW in 1788, First Fleet convict Ruse claimed his sentence had expired and asked Governor Phillip for some land so he could become a farmer. Partially sceptical of Ruse but in genuine need of sustainable crops for food, Phillip told Ruse he could have 30 acres of land at Parramatta if he could become self-sufficient from it.\n\nWith true scientific commitment, typical of a man of Enlightenment, the Governor gave Ruse seed, tools, livestock, and helped prepare a small plot of land ready for farming. Ruse worked hard, fighting drought and poor quality soils, but within three years was feeding himself and his wife. \n\nPhillip, true to his word and pleased with his experiment issued the first land grant in NSW to James Ruse in April 1791. His farm became known as Experiment Farm.\n\nIn 1793, Ruse sold the farm to local Surgeon John Harris for 40 pounds and moved to the Hawkesbury region and then onto more land at Bankstown; each time toiling away only to lose his profits to gambling. \n\nHarris meanwhile renamed the farm ‘Harris’ Farm’ and continued clearing and cultivating. In 1809, he built a small house there and in 1834, a second cottage. And it's this remaining Cottage, with its sophisticated Colonial Georgian design that belies its heritage as a working farm of less than fertile soil, and has been the source of heated historical debate.\n\nSituated on a slight hill, the Cottage faces north towards Parramatta River with Clay Cliff Creek running along its front boundary. Surrounded by mature trees, its 19th-century pleasure garden has been recently reinstated, placing it firmly in the dress circle of colonial houses in the area including those once owned by the Parramatta Gentry—the Macarthurs. \n\nToday the Cottage is open to the public; restored and furnished by the National Trust according to themes and trends of the 1830s. However, some historians suggest that the Cottage was built in 1790s, which would make it the oldest house in Australia and calling the 1830s interpretation and presentation into question.\n\nThe National Trust acquired the property in 1961, and since then there has been considerable effort to recover associated property. Beginning in the 1850s, Harris’ Farm was progressively subdivided, and the resumption of some of the surrounding land has seen the formation of the adjacent James Ruse Reserve. Today a pedestrian footbridge over Clay Cliff Creek provides easy access to the Harris Park Heritage Walk, and continuous park extends from Hambledon Cottage and Hassall Street south to Experiment Farm Cottage and Alice Street in the south.\n	"Some historians suggest that the Cottage was built in 1790s, which would make it the oldest house in Australia and calling the 1830s interpretation and presentation into question."	1798-01-01	\N
45	Gum Tree	The Aboriginal Canoe Tree at Broulee bears the scar of the removal of a piece of bark by the indigenous people of the area, the Yuin people, for the purpose of making a canoe.	Aboriginal people removed large pieces of bark from gum trees for many traditional purposes.  They used the bark for containers and food implements, shields, temporary shelters, on initiation sites, as tomb stones for their deceased and, as in this case, for sustainable resource harvesting.\n\nOver 7,500 Aboriginal scarred trees have been recorded in NSW, often along major rivers and around lakes. The bark was often removed from mature trees including red gum.\n\nRespect for the cultural and spiritual significance of the gum tree is reflected in the poem below, written by Indigenous poet, Graham Ballard, from Casino. The poem Gum Tree conveys that the gum is much more than a perennial plant with a trunk.\n\n*Gum Tree*\nBy Graham Ballard \n\n*We call it the gum tree, as if it were just a thing\nNot pulsating, not whispering, not rustling around, not shedding skin,\nNot perfuming, not drinking, not perspiring, not growing, not trembling,\nNeither swaying, waving or sheltering\nNot watching, not listening, not stretching, not changing colour,\nNot bleeding, not blooming, not breeding, not singing, not shrieking,\nNot crying, not sleeping, not grieving, not breathing, not scratched and\nbleeding from a frightened goanna,\nNot tolerating raucous mobs of parrots, children\nJust there, sticking out of the ground,\nAs if we weren't so very blessed to have it there.*\n\nTo read more about the Aboriginal Canoe Tree at Broulee, click here (insert link to Aboriginal Canoe Tree_AD_story#1)\n\nTo read another indigenous poem about the native Bloodwood tree, click here (insert link:\nhttp://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/arts/this-old-bloodwood#axzz48spWT6gh\n	"We call it the gum tree, as if it were just a thing\nNot pulsating, not whispering, not rustling around, not shedding skin..."	1800-01-01	\N
56	Wild Horses	*In riding a horse, we borrow freedom* - Author unknown\n\n*The way to heaven is on horseback* - Helen Thompson\n\nThere are many quotes linking horses to freedom and heaven itself. Unfortunately for Lillian Anderson, her association with a horse trough brought only the hell of incarceration and ultimately, death.\n	The horse trough, which sits at the south of Collins Park on the north side of Forsyth Street, is the only remnant horse trough in the city area. Public horse troughs were a necessity in the bush and even in 1959 there were still eight troughs in use in the city area of Wagga. The last horses dedicated to commercial purposes within the city were retired in 1964, having been used for the deliveries of milk and bread.\n\nAnother horse trough is located at the Wagga Wagga saleyards at Bomen where a panicked young woman hid the rifle she used to shoot her husband.\n\nIn 1934, the Wagga District Coroner, a Mr Harris, conducted an inquest in to the death of Mr Moncrieff Anderson, 33, who was shot and killed near the municipal saleyards on the night of May 10. Mr Harris found that Anderson was murdered by his own wife Lillian. She was committed to Long Bay gaol for trial.\n\nLillian condemned herself when it was revealed that she had in fact confessed to the murder in a letter she had written to Edward Henry Morey, who was in gaol for murder. Lillian had been secretly writing to Morey for eight years under the pseudonym ‘Thelma Smith’ to prevent her husband from knowing. This subterfuge alone was presented as evidence of Lillian’s moral turpitude but her description of events that night sealed her fate. In court she described how she and her husband “Crieffy” had gone to the water trough to shoot some cats that they believed had been stealing their chickens.\n\n*We took the rifle to the trough last night to shoot some cats, and I shot Crieffy. It was an accident. I did not mean to shoot him. We had three bantams with feathers on the legs and two others. Cats had killed one of them. Crieffy said the cats are a nuisance. Fetch the rifle and we will wait up there for a while and shoot some of them. Crieffy got the rifle, loaded it, and stood it outside with the little bucket. He said, “You carry the rifle and be careful how you carry it, as it might go off." We walked to the water trough. I turned around to the left, and I think the rifle must have got caught in my coat. It went off. I did not know what to do as I had a big shock, so I put it in the trough and called out to Albert Krause to come up, and then you men came down. The ambulance came and took him away. That is all I want to say."*\n	"Lillian had been secretly writing to Morey for eight years under the pseudonym ‘Thelma Smith’ to prevent her husband from knowing."	1934-01-01	\N
62	Eat your heart out Masterchef 	The Cook’s Galley was a kitchen on location. It operated as the mobile food van in the fields where horse chaff was cut and bagged. This was damned hard yakka and involved 11-hour days and a truckload of tucker to keep the teams going.	\nIn the 1920s in NSW there were 662,000 horses: one for every two people. Despite the arrival of the car, horses remained invaluable. They carried and hauled all manner of loads across all manner of terrain. The only downside was that they had to be fed. And working horses ate a lot—needing three meals a day of chopped hay, called chaff, mixed with grain. \n\nFodder was required in the locations where the horses worked, whether it be city or country, so fodder was produced, bagged, transported and stockpiled at depots in towns and cities. For many years, the largest building at Sydney’s Central railway was the hay shed, where fuel for the city's horses was handled.\n\nIn Wagga Wagga there were several fixed chaff mills, one at The Rock, and another in Norton Street not far from the Murrumbidgee Cooperative Milling Company, but getting the hay to these mills was often problematic, and the preferred method was to take the chaff cutter to the hay instead.\n\nThe Fife family were a cut above—excuse the pun—most other chaff cutters. In the 1930s they built the Cook’s Kitchen to complete their modern day rig of steam engine tractor, chaff cutter, wood wagon, steam box and water cart.\n\nThe kitchen was towed behind and was much like a railway goods wagon with planked wooden walls. Inside contained a coal fired stove and benches for preparation with storage bins below. \n\nIn a style to rival Masterchef, every day three meals were prepared. Breakfast consisted of sausages and toast; lunch was the big affair of the day with roast meat and vegetables followed by pudding. At sundown, cold meat, bread, and salad were served. Scones, jam tarts and biscuits appeared at morning and afternoon teas and in full production, 16 men could be fed from the kitchen.\n\nAfter which the cook was likely to need a good lie down. Luckily the Fifes anticipated this and provided hooks from which he could sling his hammock and hunker down below his Wagga rug until the next day dawned.	"In a style to rival Masterchef, every day three meals were prepared."	\N	\N
72	Wagga’s bullocky bells	The historic Council Chambers were once the staging depot for Cobb and Co coaches. Before the railway connected Wagga with Sydney, horse-drawn coaches provided transport between most regional towns. Wool, wheat and other heavy loads were hauled by bullock trains, which had several advantages over horse-drawn loads. They were stronger than horses, could manage on rough tracks, graze roadside without running off, and needed no shoeing. 	However, they did require bells. Livestock bells were used to locate grazing animals. Owners could discern the sound of the bell that identified their herds. With the implementation of the 1861 Robertson Land Act, which provided land for £1 per acre, Wagga’s sprawling squatters’ runs of the late 1840s were divided into smaller farms. More herds necessitated a greater diversity of bell. Blacksmiths began to prosper, and the making of bullock bells became a competitive pastime.\n\nOne such blacksmith, German immigrant August Menneke relocated to Wagga in 1867 from Albury. Interestingly, in 1876 Albury was officially called ‘Germantown’ on account of the large population of German immigrants who settled there.\n\nMenneke seems to have been one hell of a smithy and became famed for his bullock bells and yokes made from bull oak, a species of Allocasaurina which grew along the river’s edge. It is one of the hardest timbers in the world—for those in-the-know, it’s Janke rating is 5060 lbf. Apparently, it was a common sight to see several bullock teams pulled up on the banks of the Murrumbidgee in front of Menneke's blacksmith shop for repairs to wagons, wheels and harnesses.\n\nThe bells were made from a piece of steel rolled and shaped. He strengthened the joints with a brass alloy that gave the bell a melodious penetrating sound. Exactly how ‘penetrating’ was fought out in a competition between Anthony Mongan of Albury and August Menneke, who according to legend, carried their bells to the top of Mt. Kosciusko to determine whose bell could be heard furthest away. Menneke’s bell tolled clearly 10 miles away.\nIn a 1947 letter in the Daily Advertiser from D.W Cassidy, then owner of one of Menneke’s famed bells said: “I have heard it at a distance of six miles while it was on a horse's neck on the plains in the Hay district, just before daylight when all nature was at rest.”\n\nThe Museum of the Riverina has two Menneke bells in their collection. Individually called a ‘Wagga Pot’, the bells are stamped with his name.	"It was a common sight to see several bullock teams pulled up on the banks of the Murrumbidgee in front of Menneke's blacksmith shop for repairs to wagons, wheels and harnesses."	1881-01-01	\N
78	The cold-makers	Thomas Mort, the owner of the Bodalla Estate, is chronicled as a man of the people with a philanthropic and generous nature. So the fact that there was a live-in doctor on the estate, hardly comes as a surprise.  However, aside from his obligation to his employees, there were other reasons to have a doctor in the house.  	Apart from Mort’s commitment to his employees, it is also likely that the presence of a doctor on the estate was due to his continual ill-health. Mort is referred to as a hypochondriac, but perhaps the ‘Father of Australian Industries,’ was suffering bouts of stress and chronic fatigue, as a result of his hectic and nerve-racking entrepreneurial lifestyle.\n\nDuring his lifetime he lead the way in wool brokerage, was a founder of AMP, a pastoral speculator, builder of the first dry dock in Sydney, established a prosperous and high yielding dairy farm at Bodalla, a director of a tin, copper, coal and engineering company, and a pioneer of refrigeration! \nHis unwavering commitment to refrigeration; ‘making cold’ saw him invest over £100,000 into the venture.  The story goes that Mort had heard about the discovery of a prehistoric mammoth preserved in the frozen wastelands of Russia and had dreamt of exporting frozen meat to England ever since. \nMort was greeted with hostility and public ignorance, after all who would want to eat meat after it had been refrigerated? Despite Mort’s enthusiasm and massive investment, progress was slow and in the finish, South America ended up delivering the first frozen cargo to England a year before Mort’s death. \nDespite being pipped at the post, they did ‘make cold’ on Mort’s 58th birthday, at the Darling Harbour freezing works.  The equipment was used for chilling meat at the Blue Mountains abattoir and also enabled the delivery of the Bodalla Estate’s milk, cheese and butter to Sydney.\nYou can visit the place where Mort was tended to by his doctor during bouts of stress and fatigue, and only imagine the determination and incredible trail-blazing efforts of this one great man, who significantly contributed to Australian commercialism as we know it today.\n	"Mort was greeted with hostility and public ignorance, after all who would want to eat meat after it had been refrigerated?" 	1870-01-01	1879-01-01
87	 Water, water, everywhere, And not a drop to drink	Well, perhaps there was not water everywhere in Wagga in the late 1800s but there was certainly a plentiful supply in the Murrumbidgee River flowing through the town. Harnessing this precious resource proved more of a challenge than expected.	The Wagga Waterworks building was built between 1883 and 1886. Water was pumped from the river to a reservoir on Willan’s Hill and then supplied by gravity feed to the town of Wagga.\n\nThe building of the Waterworks was a frustrating process. The project was instigated in 1879 under a new law providing for the co-operation between local authorities and the central Government for major building works. Plans were approved, a reservoir constructed and the pump house built but by 1885, the pipes had still not been delivered. Local journalists described the situation as most vexatious. But, what really infuriated the local citizens was that the Government then insisted that the project required a First and Second Engineer and that the cost of employing and housing the two men must be born by the local council. The salaries promised to the engineers by the Government were £200 and £100. Furthermore, the council was informed that plans had been arranged for a new house each for the engineers at a cost of  £960 and  £600.\n\nThe cost of building the Waterworks plant was double that of the original estimate. The council took on the £40,000 debt, paying it off in small annual instalments. There was open hostility between the Government and the council who felt that it had been deceived and held to ransom by the Government. However, the local community also railed against the council for its ineptitude in brokering the deal and at the prospect of being forced to pay higher rates to enable the council to recover its liability.\n\nThe consternation of the Wagga residents was raised again when, in 1889, the large steam pump, imported from London, broke down. For some time the engineer had been warning that the pump needed an overhaul but his submissions to the council were ignored. When a particularly damning report finally galvanized the councillors into action, agreeing to order a new pump from America via Sydney, they spent the next five months arguing about the design. Eventually the valves gave out and the town was only given limited water supply. \n\nThe town water service was again disrupted in 1919 when a dead dog was found to be obstructing the Baylis Street service main. There was much speculation as to how the dog came to be in the drain and it was proposed by the waterworks engineer that it must have gotten into the trough at the reservoir. How the dog got into the elevated trough and through the pump house was a mystery but human intervention was suspected and a £10 reward was offered for any information on the case.	"When a particularly damning report finally galvanized the councillors into action, agreeing to order a new pump from America via Sydney, they spent the next five months arguing about the design."	1885-01-01	\N
102	Theatre inferno\n	In the early hours of Sunday 13 November 1932, the Fire Brigade was called to a fire at Wagga’s 1915 Strand Theatre where the Plaza Cinema now stands. That night The Strand had screened *The Wet Parade*, which was lost in the flames. The movie, directed by Victor Fleming of *Gone with the Wind* fame, was clearly not prescient to the theatre's fate.	The fire investigation found no apparent cause. The only suspect was a kerosene tin found on the premises, but was reported as “untouched”. \n\nThe Strand’s 800 red tip-back seats, 40 box seats, 200 on the balcony, and two pianos were all fuel to the flames. An audience of 3000—many more than those who had seen the movie—watched the spectacular inferno that night. \n\nTheatre fires were a well-documented phenomenon all over the world in the 19th and 20th centuries. From earliest times when large numbers of people congregate in one place fires have wreaked havoc, destroying property and causing horrendous loss of life.\n\nVenice’s famous *La Fenice* has been destroyed by fire three times, in 1774, 1836 and most famously in 1996. Fires destroying Shakespeare’s *Globe Theatre* and at London’s *Her Majesty's Theatre* caused headlines worldwide.\n\nMajor fires have also struck closer to home. In Sydney, fires damaged or destroyed:\n•    The Theatre Royal in George Street, 1840 and again in its Castlereagh Street location in 1892\n•    The Prince of Wales in 1860 and 1872\n•    The Royal Victoria Theatre in 1880\n•    The Tivoli in 1899 \n•    Her Majesty’s Theatre in 1902\n\nMelbourne had a similar story with spectacular fires in the Duke of Edinburgh Theatre in 1871 and the Bijou Theatre in 1889 both in Bourke Street. \n\nRegional theatres were not immune. Faults with gas and electric lighting, onstage explosions and fireworks used in performances, and large capacity buildings have in part been to blame.\n\nAccording to Ross Thorne, who wrote a Ph.D. on the topic, the NSW Government responded to this long line of disasters by holding a “Royal Commission into the Construction of Theatres, Public Halls and Other Places of Public Amusement or Concourse” in 1882. Aiming to weed out inferno causing practices and materials, the Commission resulted in the “Theatres and Public Halls Act” legislation which was passed by the Parliament in 1906.\n\nSo cinema fires should have been a thing of the past.\n\nBut not so for The Strand, which had to be demolished. Out of its ashes came The Plaza Theatre	"So cinema fires should have been a thing of the past."	1915-01-01	\N
108	Typhoid tea party	Tent Town, the shanty town that sprawled from Hampden Bridge to the river bend had no sewage system. Drinking water was taken from the river and toilet waste emptied into it. The public health concerns were reported as a “menace to Wagga” and during the Depression 16 cases of diphtheria, one case of scarlet fever and a case of typhoid were reported.	In March 1932, the Daily Advertiser reported that the suspected typhoid case was linked with a contaminated well in Tent Town.\n\nApparently, the well had been illegally sunk, and Mr Lewis (link to Tent Town Story 1), the municipal health officer had requested the well be filled in after samples he took from it returned significant contamination from the nearby sanitary depot.\n\nThere had been some delay in achieving this and in the meantime three small girls from Tent Town had a tea party with water from the well. \n\nAccording to the newspaper, the “little girl and two small friends had decided to hold a party. One of them obtained some peaches and then some water was drawn from the condemned well. The children drank some and boiled peaches in the remainder. This made a fine tea party and the children thoroughly enjoyed themselves.”\n\nTheir merriment ceased however when one of the girls came down with appendicitis-like symptoms and was taken to the hospital. Inspector Lewis stated that he attributed the girl’s illness to drinking of the well water.\n\nIt was not the first time Wagga had suffered from typhoid outbreaks. There were at least eight cases in 1889 when a specialist nurse was brought in from Sydney to manage the epidemic. In 1909, there were 99 reported cases and 57 the year before that. In 1912 an outbreak saw five children hospitalised. \n\nThe sewer was installed in Wagga in 1917 at a cost of 45,000 pounds, and from then the town experienced a sharp decline in typhoid outbreaks. So the typhoid tea incident came as some surprise to residents, despite the fact that Tent Town coexisted with the garbage dump until the last occupants were moved in the early 1950s.\n	"It was not the first time Wagga had suffered from typhoid outbreaks."	1900-01-01	\N
54	Gold Fever	“The discovery of the fact by Mr Hargraves that the country, from the Mountain Ranges to an indefinite extent into the interior, is one immense gold field, has produced a tremendous excitement... A complete mental madness appears to have seized almost every member of the community, and, as a natural consequence there has been an universal rush to the diggings.”\nBathurst Free Press, May 1851\n	In 1851, Edward Hargraves discovered a ‘grain of gold’ in a waterhole near Bathurst.  Soon the nation was gripped by gold fever. The gold rushes brought great economic development and social change, particularly with the huge influx of migrants, and ensured that those towns closest to the goldfields grew rapidly from the 1850s until the turn of the century when gold fever had subsided.\n\nIn 1851 gold was discovered in the Moruya district and the Araluen goldfield was established. In 1861 gold was discovered at Gulph Creek near Nerrigundah and the population swelled to over 7000 inhabitants, many of who were Chinese.  \n\nThe gold fields not only attracted prospectors and merchants but thieves and bushrangers as well.  Australia’s ‘bloodiest’ bushranger gang, the Clarke Brothers, terrorized the southern gold fields and in 1866 they held up the townspeople of Nerrigundah, escaping with gold and valuables after fatally shooting the town policeman, Constable Miles O’Grady.\n\nThe gold around Nerrigundah was said to be the purest in the colony. Gold mining operations began as alluvial mining, sluicing and dredging the creeks and rivers.  Mines were also dug searching for reef gold. In the 1880s Edward J (Ned) Coman could resist temptation no longer. He mortgaged his property ‘Tyrone’ to finance a gold mining venture and with his partner Bloomfield, he established the Coman Mine at North Creek.  Sadly, they had little success and in 1889 the mine was closed. The banks foreclosed and repossessed ‘Tyrone’ and Coman and his family had to move to a small property near Tuross. Perhaps poor Coman sought comfort in Henry Lawson’s poem, The Roaring Days, published in 1889:\n\n*The night too quickly passes\nAnd we are growing old,\nSo let us fill our glasses\nAnd toast the Days of Gold;\nWhen finds of wondrous treasure\nSet all the South ablaze,\nAnd you and I were faithful mates\nAll through the roaring days.*\n\nComan’s Mine can be found on the Nerrigundah Walking Trail.  The trail includes many mining artefacts including a pile of quartz rocks that marks the entrance to the mine tunnel dug by Coman and Bloomfield.\n\nFor a modern-day insight into the gold rush days head to The Colony at Mogo, a fascinating re-creation of a gold rush town of the 1850s.\n	"In the 1880s Edward J (Ned) Coman could resist temptation no longer. He mortgaged his property ‘Tyrone’ to finance a gold mining venture and with his partner Bloomfield, he established the Coman Mine at North Creek."	\N	\N
66	The writing’s on the wall	Mogo might be best known for its zoo, but this tiny town played a part in several big histories. NSW’s gold rushes and the advent of the timber and dairy industries all had chapters written in Mogo.\n\nAnd there’s a little house in Mogo that witnessed it all. \n	With its internal walls lined with 1870s newspapers, Mogo Cottage tells more than its own story; these are walls that speak the news of the day. \n\nSupposition suggests that the story of the 21 charges against Moruya Police Magistrate and Coroner, Mr Caswell, could easily stretch the length of an entire wall. This case continued for months, and the extent of the coverage attests to Caswell's unpopularity in his community. Charges included the use of bad language and interference in a case of alleged infanticide, all of which would today amount to a conflict of interest, bullying and harassment. Reading between the lines there’s also a hint of rivalry between Catholic and Protestant, for which Moruya was known. All charges against Caswell were dismissed for lack of evidence, although he was recommended for immediate transfer. \n\nPerhaps spreads from The Moruya Examiner would recount local news such as the fire in Mr Bishop’s barn that destroyed 600-700 bushels of corn. Much emphasis is made that despite Mr Bishop having entered the barn the previous night with a “lighted candle” that he has no idea how the fire started. \n\nIn June 1870, The Moruya Telegraph carried a gripping story that should feature prominently in any wallpapering. It tells of farmer Bell, his wife and five children, who climbed onto of their “contiguous wheat stack” to escape rapidly rising floodwaters of Tuross River. The haystack, along with family, a dog, cat and kangaroo rat, was then washed into the torrent and downstream for almost a mile. During the terrifying trip, the farmer was washed off leaving the eldest daughter Lydia to ward off two bullocks—also trapped in the rushing current—from climbing aboard the haystack. Lydia, hero of the day, eventually fashions a rough paddle and steers the haystack to shore, wedging it between two trees. There they wait “a day and weary night” before being found “very much exhausted, but, thanks to Almighty Providence, unhurt.”\n\nBut what newspaper clad walls wouldn’t tell was the rather spectacular escape the house owner’s son had from bushrangers. One night, they bailed up James Veitch shouting “Your money or your life” but James spurred his horse into action narrowly escaping the bullets that ensued. \n\nThis exciting event occurred some three years after the house was built, by which time George Veitch, owner and Postmaster, was no longer reading papers, whether or not they were on the walls of his house, having died suddenly of Dropsy.\n	"The haystack, along with family, a dog, cat and kangaroo rat, was then washed into the torrent and downstream for almost a mile."	1870-01-01	\N
75	Wanted:  People to work from home – great work life balance	The early post offices in NSW were run from an office in a home.  The earliest recorded home post office was in Sydney under the responsibility of postmaster Isaac Nichols, who took charge of all the postal deliveries for the whole colony. As the decades rolled on, the post office was established as a government department, with the first post office opening in Moruya on Vulcan Street in 1855. 	The post office in Moruya was opened in a dilapidated rented shack on the corner of Vulcan and Queen Streets. The building would have been dusty, dark and damp inside; the ceilings made of bark covered in calico were rat-gnawed. The postmaster, Oliver Lodge slept on the premises as the post office was not to be unattended at night. \nThis work from home opportunity, which was an open all hours affair, dealing with contracted mailmen, money orders and trips to the wharf earned him an £18 salary. To top up this measly income, Oliver ran a shop which supplied the town with items such as gunpowder, soap and gold scales. \nIn 1886, a Sydney visitor to the area reported the unsuitability of the Vulcan Street Post Office.   Moruya is described as a very practical town that ‘has not indulged itself very much architecturally.’  \nThe early post offices were a statement of a successful community and with towns springing up and vanishing to nothing a regular occurrence, the people of Moruya would have no doubt been focused on making it known that they were here to stay.  What better way to stamp their mark of importance, than with a post office and what a grand one it was and indeed still is!\nA princely sum of £2200 was allocated and after some delays in funding, the post office was finally opened.  This building like the previous Post Office was built as a home office and reports at the time criticise the extensive home space, compared to the minuscule office space. The rear of the property has a generous stable, buggy house and harness room and the first story boasts five bedrooms with French marble mantelpieces, whilst the post boxes are not even protected from the rain.\nWhy not take a visit to the old post office, wallow in its grandiose charm and ponder which lucky postmaster won the home office lottery!\n	"A princely sum of £2200 was allocated and after some delays in funding, the post office was finally opened."	1887-01-01	1926-01-01
86	Mad Dogs and Englishmen	The Wagga Wagga Courthouse saw its fair share of rogues and criminals file through its doors. The bushrangers Captain Moonlite and James Kelly, younger brother of Ned, stood before the Court Magistrate to be sentenced. Several criminal cases brought media attention and fame to the city of Wagga Wagga. One case was so intriguing that it convinced Mark Twain to visit the town himself.	One of the Courthouse’s more notorious guests was ‘Mad Dog’ (Daniel) Morgan, reportedly one of the most violent bushrangers to terrorise the states of NSW and Victoria. In 1864 Mad Dog Morgan was arrested for the shooting of Police Magistrate Harry Baylis and was tried in the Wagga Wagga Courthouse.\n\nPossibly a psychopath by today’s standards, Morgan was not averse to torturing his victims but was also known to have occasionally attempted to nurse his victims and tend to their wounds. His most heinous act was when he forced the wife of a suspected police informant to sit upon the open flames of her kitchen stove. He doused her with water only after she was fully alight.\n\nIn 1976, Hollywood actor Dennis Hopper played Morgan in Philippe Mora’s film, Mad Dog Morgan. Hopper so thoroughly immersed himself in the mad, drunken violence of his character that several of the cast and crew were afraid to work with him. At one point the make-up artists complained that they could no longer work with him because he had refused to bathe for three weeks. The stench was overwhelming but eventually he was persuaded to throw himself in the river, as Mad Dog himself would have done.\n\nWagga Wagga’s most famous criminal identity was that of the imposter, Thomas Castro. In 1864 Castro claimed to have been living under a pseudonym and that he was in fact a member of the British aristocracy, Sir Roger Charles Tichborne. Tichborne had been mysteriously lost at sea, presumed dead, some nine years earlier. \n\nRemarkably, Castro convinced Tichborne’s own mother back in England that he was in fact her long lost son and he laid claim to the family fortune. However, at the close of the second court case held in London it was shown that the defendant was neither Thomas Castro nor Roger Tichborne, but a fraudster named Arthur Orton who was actually a butcher from Wapping. \n\nSuch was the international interest in this case that special postcards were produced as souvenirs and it was this case that brought the American author Mark Twain to Wagga. The Museum of the Riverina displays a number of mass-produced figurines of the key characters in the trial, which were manufactured as mementos of the scandal. The Museum was also proud to display a bullet shot from Mad Dog Morgan’s own gun. Alas, it has been stolen!	"The Museum of the Riverina displays a number of mass-produced figurines of the key characters in the trial, which were manufactured as mementos of the scandal."	1899-01-01	1902-01-01
94	How to train a river	Getting a river to behave is a tricky thing. Rivers have carved valleys, moved mountains and their alluvial power is such that it’s no wonder the ever-shifting sands of the Wagonga Inlet caused so many headaches.	The moveable feast at the mouth of the river comprises thousands of tonnes of river and beach sand that is deposited north, south and at the river mouth in continually changing cycles. Unpredictable currents exacerbated by strong tides in the past made navigation up or down the coast a dangerous occupation.\nFrom the late 1880s dredgers were periodically employed to improve access and safety, but the shifting sands returned and by the turn of the century ships were unable to enter or leave sometimes for weeks on end. \nThe government vowed to improve the situation and in 1919 began constructing two short ‘training walls’ designed to define a deeper channel for ships to use by keeping the shifting sands at bay. They carried out ‘rock blanketing’ to stabilise the walls in 1921, but all was still not well. \nThat year, Pilot Charles Knott blamed the lazy dredge masters who instead of taking the sand out to sea dumped it upstream so that it all washed back to the mouth, saying “where we used to have 70ft of water we now have 2 feet.” \nThe Wee Clyde was the only steamer able to slip over the shallow bar with her beam to the breakers. Built locally with this in mind, she too was stranded with a cargo of cheese and timber several times during the early 20s.\nDespite engineers and surveyors visiting and committees writing reports, the headaches—and ship losses—continued. The shoaling sands would not be tamed.\nIn 1927, the eastern wall of the breakwater was partially extended. Dredging continued in 1928 and 1929 to create a 45m wide by 2.5m deep channel between the two wharves. In 1932, the walls were again extended, raised and repaired. At this time, the western wall was extended some 600m upstream.\nShipping troubles did not abate, and pressure continued to mount as commercial fishing swung into production in the Inlet. Formal breakwaters were installed and in the 1970s, the southern breakwater was fortified with concrete armour units. \nToday, difficulties continue. Sand shifts and settles, evading direction or control despite concrete and granite blocks and stronger, longer, and higher walls. \nFor those following this 130-year-old story, it might now be clear that you can’t train a river after all.\n	"Today, difficulties continue. Sand shifts and settles, evading direction or control despite concrete and granite blocks and stronger, longer, and higher walls."\n	\N	\N
98	The struggle for Salvation	The early churches in Wagga were built in a flurry between 1859 and 1869. They chose an elevated spot where the meandering Murrumbidgee loops around to the north and called it Church Hill. The Hill soon sported several handsome churches each vying for the attentions of a not-so-repentant population.	\nThe Catholics were the first ready. By 1859 they had St Michael’s finished at its Church Street location before they upscaled to a Cathedral in the 1880s at its present Johnston Street site. They laid their foundations well and proceeded to spawn St Joseph’s School, presbytery, and a convent for the five Sisters of Presentation, who arrived in 1874.\n\nClose on their heels were the Anglicans who also chose Church Street as home, building their church in 1861, followed by a rectory, St John’s Hall and St Peter’s and St Luke’s as satellites, some time later. \n\nThe Presbyterians cobbled together enough money to get St Andrew’s up and running on a corner of Cross and Church Street while the Wesleyan Methodists nabbed a spot on Johnson Street closer to the Police Station and Court House.\n\nThe Church of Christ despite having a dedicated congregation from 1885 onwards, failed to get a roof over their heads until 1915.\n\nWagga Wagga was certainly a place to do redemption business. Bushrangers Frank Gardiner, Johnny Gilbert, and John Dunn were causing havoc, and Mad Dan Morgan had robbed the Police Magistrate Henry Baylis in Urana in 1863 before exchanging shots with Sergeant Carroll in 1864. Horse and cattle rustling was common, as was drunkenness, theft, and brawling. The delights of the Chinese-run opium dens (link) and gambling rooms, along with prostitution could be enjoyed every night of the week.  \n\nSo clearly, all manner of souls needed saving, but when the Salvation Army—the new kids on the block—marched into town in 1885 to do their bit, many turned against them. \n\nThe evangelical mission of The Salvation Army was met with suspicion, derision and violence. Their street meeting and public marches attracted widespread opposition from residents who banded together to form a ‘Skeleton Army’, throwing stones, rotten eggs, and flour at them. \nNewspaper reports indicate several related incidents. In 1896 Charles Wright was prosecuted for throwing a bottle of beer at a Salvation Army man that “struck him over the temple, inflicting a serious wound …”. \n\nBut by 1900, the Salvationists had their patch marked out. They had opened a citadel in Morrow Street, and along with the other churches were struggling to bring stability to the roguish and reprobate town.	"The evangelical mission of The Salvation Army was met with suspicion, derision and violence.

105	Eat, Grow, Buy Australian	The Murrumbidgee Flour Mill did more than simply process wheat for flour.\nIt supported local industry, provided employment, contributed to the success of Wagga as a regional centre and contributed to the birth of the Chiko Roll.\n	In 1923 Fred R. Burley, founder of the underwear giant Berlei Limited, established the Australian Made Preference League and became its president. Just like the Australian entrepreneur Dick Smith, Burley urged the public to ‘buy Australian’ believing it for vital to the Australian economy and way of life to purchase Australian made goods over imported ones. \n\nIn 1925, Mr William Bagnall was made the league’s Managing Director. To promote the aims of the League, Bagnall organized an advertising campaign, devising the Great White Train Tour to travel the country. The Great White Train visited Wagga Wagga in March 1926 and stayed for four days. The League was sponsored by famous brands including Berger, Tooheys and Uncle Tobys and when the train visited Wagga it was supported by many local businesses including the Murrumbidgee Flour Mill.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the Federal Government encouraged farmers and new settlers to grow more wheat. In 1931 the campaign was promoted with the slogan, “From Golden Dawn to Crimson Sunset, Grow More Wheat.” Unfortunately, the campaign was not supported by funding or guarantee and during the Great Depression of the 1930s, many farmers went into debt and faced unemployment and financial ruin.\n\nThe Murrumbidgee Flour Mill remained in business and provided employment for many in the Wagga district running three shifts a day, every day except Sunday. The flour produced by the mill was known as “Wagga Lily” and was more than likely used to create that icon of Australian cuisine, the Chiko Roll.\n\nThe Chiko Roll was launched at the Wagga Wagga Agricultural Show in 1951 and was an immediate success, selling out on only the second day. It was the creation of Mr Francis (Frank) Gerald McEnroe, a boilermaker from Bendigo, who also ran a large mobile catering business with his brothers between the 1930s and 1950s. Frank saw the need for a hot snack that could be eaten at race meetings and other shows and sporting events. Seeing another man selling chicken rolls outside a football field, Frank was inspired to create his own “chicken” roll. The rolls contained mutton, carrots, celery, cabbage, barley and rice and the mixture was wrapped in a thick flour and egg dough and then deep-fried. Frank’s Chicken Rolls quickly became known as “Chiko” rolls. They were hugely popular and remained a fast food staple for many years to come. Never mind that they were completely devoid of chicken! 	"The Chiko Roll was launched at the Wagga Wagga Agricultural Show in 1951 and was an immediate success, selling out on only the second day."	\N	\N

63	The town needs schooling ‘cos the mills are booming!	A building is so much more than just a building and this is certainly the case with the former teacher’s residence built of double brick in 1895.  Aside from being the home of the teacher of the first school in Bateman’s Bay, its existence connects us directly to the livelihood of the Batemans Bay pioneering families, whose children attended the school during the boom times. 	The Former Teacher’s Residence was built during the reinvigoration of the milling boom in Batemans Bay.  As the biggest employer in the district, the businesses of Francis Guy and Son dominated Batemans Bay.  The Guy family industries processed local timber ready for export as far as Fiji, on their own ships, built in the family shipbuilding yard, as often as twice a week.\n\nGuy was also a good friend of the wealthy John Harris, not to be confused with but probably related to John Harris the surgeon. Harris and Guy were old friends and Harris assisted him with large advances of money to grow his timber merchant business both in Bateman’s Bay and Sydney.\n\nGuy was a strong supporter of education and in 1873, he was appointed to the school board of Batemans Bay Public School and would no doubt have been instrumental in the opening of the first schools in the area. Of course the school was dependent on sawmill families for their pupils, so when they mills closed so did the schools.\n\nGuy’s old mill was bought by the Perry Family who supplied spokes and other parts for vehicle wheels for coachbuilders.  No expense was spared in establishing the first class John Perry Turning and Spoke Factory, which was geared up to turn out 5000 spokes per week. The plant employed tradesmen and labourers skilled in turning spotted gum from local forests, into spokes for horse drawn carriage wheels for Cobb and Co.\n\nThe old mill stood on the banks of the Clyde until the mid 1980’s with Geoff Perry, grandson of the original owner still working as the factory’s manager until the Spinnaker’s Reach Apartments were built.\nTake a walk along Beach Road and take in the site of the old school and teacher’s residence and the Spinnaker Reach Apartments at Perry’s Mill and imagine the rafts of logs floating down the river Clyde.\n	"Of course the school was dependent on sawmill families for their pupils, so when they mills closed so did the schools."	1895-01-01	\N
74	Flying the flag	Before two-way radios, GPS and sat-navs, and up-to-the-minute coast guard navigation advice, communicating with ships was done by waving flags.	Semaphore communication was a maritime standard and signals were made by hand and by hoisting flags up semaphore poles. If there was a black ball hoisted on Narooma’s flagstaff, the message was that the bar was not safe to cross. At night, a red light was added warning sailors not to enter. If the Inlet was passable, flags indicating the best channel were hoisted to the flagpole along with a white light at night.\n\nDespite this relatively sophisticated system, human error was not unheard of, as the Pilot Log of 1914 indicates: “Wee Clyde coming in against red light, dead low water. Grounded on bar”. Someone wasn’t watching the flags. \n\nAfter the loss of the Bodalla on the rocks in 1924, a rocket system was installed. If a boat foundered on rock or bar, the rocket was fired to the ship and the rope that trailed it was used to secure the ship and bring it to safety.\n\nFor many years, there was a permanent chain around to the now famous, Rock of Australia, which was also used to secure ships from becoming flotsam and jetsam during high seas. Myth has it that the shape of Australia was carved in the rock by continual use for this purpose. \n\nChief flag fliers were the pilots; they knew the sea, the bar and the river well, and according to historian Laurelle Pacey, often risked their lives for others. John Ross was appointed as the first pilot in 1902 and was followed by Charles Knott, who clocked up multiple rescues and near-misses during his time as pilot. \n\nIn 1924, he saved two tourists whose boat was overturned by a large wave. After “suffering a severe tossing in the breakers”, the tourists decided to swim for shore. Mr Knott quickly had the lifeboat out arrived to prevent death by exposure and took the men to town. The newspaper concludes with the chilling note: "The bar is known to be infested with sharks."\n\nPilots oversaw shipping into and out of the port until 1962 when Pilot Les Flukes retired. The volunteer coastal patrol now operates from the Pilot Station.\n\nThe flagstaff, which no longer stands—though its concrete footings are still in situ—was located slightly south of where the Pilot Station currently is as the station was rebuilt in the 1950s. \n	"After “suffering a severe tossing in the breakers”, the tourists decided to swim for shore. Mr Knott quickly had the lifeboat out arrived to prevent death by exposure and took the men to town."	1906-01-01	\N
82	Am-Dram, Agriculture and Abstinence!	The Temperance Hall, which is today ‘Green Gables,’ bed and breakfast, despite its modifications, is still significant as the first community building in the area. During its heyday the hall was at the centre of community events for the families that lived in the small secluded town of Tilba Tilba. The Hall played a vital role in creating a community, and together with the rest of the village, represents a small moment in 19th century Australian family life.	Tilba Tilba nestles beneath the majestic Mount Dromedary surrounded by rugged hills and gentle undulating countryside; it would have been a home away from home for the British settlers who chose to make the spot their home. \n\nTilba Tilba was isolated and to reach the nearest towns of Bega and Moruya on cleared bush tracks with no drainage, grading or surfacing would have been quite a slow and tortuous affair!\n\nHenry Bate was the first resident in Tilba Tilba and he didn’t waste any time in acquiring extensive property in the district. Keen to make a respectful community, the Bates invited a family friend from their home town in Britain, Henry William Corkhill and others, with a similar social standing and class followed.\n\nHenry Corkhill joined by other Anglican families became a passionate advocate of the district. Like many early settlement tales, Tilba Tilba provided a constant struggle for her new inhabitants. There was not a great deal of good farm land, and so getting enough to eat and make a living was a constant battle. \n\nFor a short while gold saved the town, when there was a small goldmining boom which lasted until 1906.  The Mount Dromedary gold field employed 50 men, and by the mid 1870’s the town boasted a hotel, 2 general stores, a milliner, 2 blacksmiths, 2 butchers, a coachbuilder 6 or so houses and a temperance hall.\n\nWhilst the hall would have been built to keep the miners away from the hotel, whether it was successful or not is not known, but the locals were clearly glad of its existence. The local families developed a rich and successful social life with the Temperance Hall at the centre of this social whirl, home to church fetes, agricultural shows, amateur dramatics, brass band, cricket, football and tennis fundraisers and ping pong tournaments!\n\nPay a visit to the Temperance Hall and imagine this happy and passionate community celebrating their lives together with dancing until the small hours!\n	"Whilst the hall would have been built to keep the miners away from the hotel, whether it was successful or not is not known, but the locals were clearly glad of its existence."	\N	\N
89	 The German Connection	German settlers began to arrive in Australia in large numbers from 1838, when immigrants from Prussia landed in Adelaide, first settling in South Australia. They established the vineyards in the Barossa Valley and moved throughout South Australia, Victoria, NSW and Queensland growing wheat and producing wine and dairy products. In Wagga, Joseph Menneke established himself as a famous blacksmith.\n	From the 1850s many German migrants came to Australia to escape rising nationalist sentiment and persecution for their Lutheran religious beliefs. From then until World War 1 the German community comprised the largest group of non-British or Irish European settlers in Australia.\n\nIn the late 1840s, three German families were contracted to establish a vineyard at ‘Kyeamba’, approximately 52 kilometres from Wagga before moving to Albury to grow their own vines. More German families settled in the Riverina to plant vineyards and today the area produces wine of many varieties including Riesling, chardonnay, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon.\n\nWhen war broke out in 1914 German Australians found themselves under suspicion and were regarded with fear and animosity. Many were interned in camps at Trial Bay, Berrima Gaol and Holsworthy Army Barracks. Generally, the community around Wagga Wagga was tolerant of the German people living in the district and in 1915 and 1917, the Council voted against the internment of these ‘enemy aliens’.\n\nThe Museum of the Riverina houses a collection of German settler artifacts including a bell made by the German blacksmith, Joseph Menneke. Menneke worked in North Wagga during the 1860s, importing all of his metal from Germany. He became famous for the bells and other goods that he manufactured for the bullock drivers and they affectionately referred to the Menneke bell as ‘The Wagga Pot’. Legend has it that a competition was held at the top of Mount Kosiusko to determine the best bell maker in Australia. Menneke won the competition with his fine bell, which could be heard clearly ten miles away.\n\nWagga resident poet and writer, Dame Mary Gilmore immortalized Menneke’s bells in her poem Bells and Bullocks:\n\n    *Once in a while we ask if he hears\n    The sound of Mennicke's (sic) bells\n    Deep in the pits of his ancient ears \n    Repeating their olden spells\n    'Mennicke's bells?' Then he'll say\n    Never heard none like 'em\n    Mennicke, he had the way \n    No one else could strike ‘em*	"... Many were interned in camps at Trial Bay, Berrima Gaol and Holsworthy Army Barracks. Generally, the community around Wagga Wagga was tolerant of the German people living in the district and in 1915 and 1917, the Council voted against the internment of these ‘enemy aliens’."	\N	\N
101	Mind the gap	Once you’ve finished admiring the elegant symmetry of the Wagga Railway Station, built by the father of NSW railways John Whitton, and remarked “that they don’t make buildings like this anymore”, remember to mind the gap.\n	\nState Rail has spent big on this safety campaign, warning avid backpackers, half-asleep commuters, octogenarians, and mums with prams and toddlers in tow, not to inadvertently fall between the train and the platform.\n\nAnd perhaps it has saved countless lives. But one elderly Wagga Wagga resident Miss Diamond could have done with a gentle reminder.\n\nAccording to a 1932 newspaper report in the Wagga Wagga Express, she had gone to the station to farewell the Presentation Sisters from Mt. Erin Convent who were leaving on an express train for Melbourne.\n\nWith time up her sleeve, Miss Diamond had boarded the carriage and taken tea with the Sisters. Once done with the tea and sponge, and being a little too slow to heed the conductor’s whistle, she had attempted to climb down from the compartment when she fell between the now moving train and the platform.\n\nSeveral carriages passed her by before the train could be brought to a standstill. On being rescued by railway staff, Miss Diamond was taken to the hospital for severe shock though she sustained only minor injuries from the fall.\n\nIt was noted that she “had a miraculous escape from serious injury” something perhaps in which the Sisters played a part.\n\nMore curious however, than the possibility of divine intervention in Miss Diamond's fate, is the report of the same incident carried in the Maitland Daily Mercury. In this newspaper, the “Amazing Escape” is attributed to a young girl, named as “Miss Dimon” who had been meeting a friend on the Melbourne Express and when realising the train was moving, “dashed” to get off, but alas forgot to mind the gap. This report omits any mention of the Sisters’ presence and the shared afternoon tea.\n\nCurious and curiouser. All the same—to avoid falling down the rabbit hole of history or between train and track; best to mind the gap.

106	Walzing Matilda\n	The Wollundry Lagoon gardens contain a statue of the Jolly Swagman, the character made famous in Banjo Patterson’s bush-ballad, *Walzing Matilda*. Patterson wrote the poem in 1895 to the music of an old Scottish folk tune, as played to him by Christina McPherson on a zither. There are several versions of the song. Below are the lyrics written in 1903 by Marie Cowan to advertise Billy Tea.\n	 Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong\nUnder the shade of a coolibah tree,\nAnd he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled:\n"Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me?"\n\n*Chorus:*\nWaltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda\nYou'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me\nAnd he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled:\n"You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me."\n\nDown came a jumbuck to drink at that billabong.\nUp jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee.\nAnd he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag:\n"You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me."\n\n*(Chorus)*\n\nUp rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred.\nDown came the troopers, one, two, and three.\n"Whose is that jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?\nYou'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me."\n\n*(Chorus)*\n\nUp jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong.\n"You'll never take me alive!" said he\nAnd his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong:\n"Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me?"		\N	\N
107	Crossing over	Getting across a river was always a problem in the early days of European settlement. The first river crossing marked on the 1849 map of the tiny town of Wagga Wagga, appears to be a ford. Squatters, pastoralists and anyone going to and from Sydney needed to cross the mighty Murrumbidgee and consequently, had to get their feet wet.\n	So bridges were big business. \n\nAnd so in 1860, frustrated by the NSW government’s refusal to fund publicly a bridge over the Murrumbidgee, a small group of squatters formed the Wagga Wagga Bridge Company. In doing so, they created a monopoly that was to line their pockets for many years to come. \n\nThe Company built the first bridge across the river in return for charging a toll to all who used it.\n\nThis franchise was registered in Parliament in 1861 and included a demarcation zone of two miles either side of the bridge and the water under it. Crossing anywhere, by any means within this zone required payment of the toll. Crossing by boat, punt or by fording horses or cattle across the river without payment resulted in a financial penalty.\n\nThere was constant resentment about the toll and in 1866, the matter of penalty and the declaration of the collection zone around the bridge were challenged in the Supreme Court of NSW. The Court found against the Company.\n\nDespite this, the toll on the bridge remained, and the Company fought long and hard to protect their investment and to prevent others from providing free passage across the river.\n\nIn 1884 the Government finally purchased the bridge, removing the toll and ending 13 years of bitter struggle by the Free Punt Association to ferry people, buggies, horsemen and mail across the river free of charge.\n\nBy 1890, the bridge was falling apart and in danger of collapse and was replaced by a timber truss bridge. Truss bridges were all the rage at the time being sturdy and modern; the Department of Public Works built 550 similar bridges including the very flash swing bridges at Pyrmont and Glebe Island.\n\nThis second rendition of a river crossing for Wagga was named Hampden Bridge, after Governor Lewis Balfour Hampden. The current Wiradjuri Bridge located further north replaced Hampden Bridge in 1995. \n	"the Company fought long and hard to protect their investment and to prevent others from providing free passage across the river."\n	1860-01-01	1880-01-01
