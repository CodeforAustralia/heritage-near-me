As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss."
5051393,Graythwaite,"The gracious Graythwaite House is an early example of a prominent and wealthy North Shore residence which has been altered extensively over its life to reflect the social standing and status of its changing ownership. The early development of the property is associated with Thomas Walker, Deputy Commissary General, whose substantial two-storey residence 'Euroka' built in the mid 1830s is encapsulated within 'Graythwaite' and, together with the detached stables, are arguably the earliest remaining fabric of the early settlement of North Sydney. Its present use as a convalescent home reflects the compassion and generosity of Thomas Allwright Dibbs to provide a caring place for Australian soldiers on their return from the Great War. The grounds on which 'Graythwaite' is located retains intact its size and configuration of the 1873 subdivision and it contains remnants of the extensive garden, as well as retaining those magnificent harbour views and vistas to the south and west."
5051394,Elizabeth Farm,"Want to experience history rather than just read about it? At Elizabeth Farm - Australia’s oldest surviving homestead - you can wander freely through the old house and garden as if you were its original occupants. There are no barriers, locked doors, fragile furniture or untouchable ornaments in this unique, ‘access all areas’ house museum.   Built in 1793 for John Macarthur, known as the father of the wool industry, and his wife Elizabeth, tales of migration and new starts, passion and anguish, early colonial political skulduggery and the genesis of Australia’s wool trade are cemented into these walls. So come by, run your hand along the sofa, or simply sit on the shady verandah and enjoy the garden, experience the history and make yourself at home.   The property is also significant in the history of conservation in NSW, being the first to be preserved by direct acquisition by the State Government, and the second property to have a permanent conservation order placed over it under the Heritage Act 1977."
5051395,St. John's Anglican Cemetery,"St John's Anglican Cemetery, Parramatta is the oldest Christian burial ground in Australia, containing graves of pioneers from the First Fleet as well as other well-known figures in the  colony, such as Reverend Samuel Marsden and David Lennox. The first recorded burial was John Magee, the child of a convict, on the 31st January 1790. The wall surrounding the cemetery was also constructed of convict-made bricks in the 1820s. A stroll around the cemetery is a chance to reflect on the pioneers who settled Australia and guided tours and night tours are available."
5051397,Parramatta District Hospital - Brislington and Landscape,"Brislington is not only the oldest colonial building in Parramatta, it also has historical significance for its long association with the medical profession and the Parramatta District Hospital. This large two-storey Old Colonial Georgian building was built in 1821 by former convict John Hodges and in 1851 was bought by Thomas Robertson, one of Parramatta's first doctors. It passed through the hands of several more men in the medical profession before being taken over by the Parramatta Hospital in 1949. With a history like that it is only fitting that the house is now a museum dedicated to medicine and nursing, with memorabilia dating from the 1880s."
5051403,Experiment Farm Cottage,"Discover the simple, yet elegant, lives of early colonial setters at Experiment Farm. On the site of the first land grant in the Australia and the first to be granted to a freed convict, James Ruse, this farm was the Governor Phillip's earliest agricultural 'experiment' to determine the period required in which a settler could become self-supporting and its initial success encouraged Phillip to open the Parramatta area to free settlement. Experiment Farm Cottage is a finely detailed colonial bungalow dating from circa 1834 and its sophistocated design is demonstrated through the architectural treatment of the front façade, including french doors, delicate columns and main entrance, and the internal treatment of room configuration and its methods of integrating the verandah into the main area of the house. The cellar houses an exhibition on the establishment of Experiment Farm and activities can be arranged for children that demonstrate how the farm became self-sufficient. The National Trust runs a regular program of other activities at the site and guided tours are available on request. Check the National Trust website for more details."
5051406,Roxy Theatre,"The Roxy is a purpose-built Inter-War Spanish Mission theatre and, with its overall form and surviving original fitout and fabric, it displays the major attributes of this building type. The theatre provides evidence of the changing nature of film theatres since the 1920s and the size and architectural character of the building also reflects American cultural influences in the interwar period and the profitability of 'Picture Palaces'. The location and origins of the theatre are closely associated with the growth of Sydney's suburbs in the interwar years and Parramatta in particular. It is an attractive and distinctive local landmark and particularly valued by the regular theatre-goers of its early years and those interested in movie and architectural history. More recently, it has been converted into a bar, restaurant and nightclub complex, perfect for a night out on the town!"
5051413,Parramatta Railway Station,"You will be taken with the charm of Parramatta Railway Station, whether travelling past, through or alighting from the train. Opened in 1860, Parramatta Railway Station, together with its extant complex of railway buildings and infrastructure, evidence the development and history of the New South Wales railway network from 1859 to the present, making it an outstanding and exceptional item of State heritage significance.  The siting of the station evidences the role of the railway paralleled with the development of the town of Parramatta and the shift in focus from the use of the river for transportation. Parramatta Railway Station in its setting, is an important civic precinct in the townscape of Parramatta, historically related to heritage items in its vicinity and through views from and to its setting, to the wider city."
5051414,Lennox Bridge - Anthony Hanna Test,"The Lennox Bridge, constructed 1836-39, is an elegantly refined and proportioned sandstone single-arch bridge. Designed by David Lennox, the then NSW Superintendent of Bridges for the colony of NSW, the bridge replaced two earlier timber structures that had been destroyed by floods. Lennox, after whom the bridge was named, was a pioneer in bridge building in Australia and this bridge proved to be the last one he designed in NSW. Take some time to visit this unique structure as the views of the Parramatta River, to and from the bridge, are just as beautiful as the bridge itself."
5051421,Centennial Park Reservoir WS001,"Centennial Park Reservoir No. 1 was the largest covered storage reservoir constructed in Australia at the time it was built and it remains very large even by present-day standards. It is a relic of the early development of the Upper Nepean Water Supply Scheme and the subsequent expansion of water reticulation throughout the suburban areas of Sydney.  The reservoir demonstrates exemplary engineering practices at the turn of the century in relation to design, construction methods and manual skills and the exterior of the reservoir has aesthetic qualities which relate to its parkland environment as a local landmark. The level of ornamentation evident in the structure also demonstrates the importance placed upon the appearance of engineering structures in the era in which it was built."
5051426,Johnston's Creek Sewer Aqueduct,"The Johnstons Creek Sewer Aqueduct, built in 1897, is a major and visibly strong component of the Northern Main Sewer extension of the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer. The arches and carrier of the aqueduct were one of the first major constructions undertaken using reinforced concrete in NSW and one of the first in Australia. The significant elements are its location within a park setting, technology of construction and past and ongoing use and the slender proportions of the supporting arches make it not only functional, but also a major landmark for Sydney."
5051456,White's Creek Aqueduct,"Completed in 1897, the Whites Creek Sewage Aqueduct is a major and highly visible component of the Northern Main Sewer extension of the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer. The arches and carrier of the aqueduct are one of the first major constructions undertaken using reinforced concrete in NSW and one of the first in Australia and the slender proportions of the supporting arches and sewage carrier make it not only functional, but also a major landmark for Sydney. The aqueduct is also a major element of the historic built environment of the local area, and a long held part of the recreational reserve."
5051459,Kunderang East Pastoral Station,"You will have the place to yourself when you and up to 13 people stay at Kunderang East Pastoral Station and Homestead. The isolated location of this place has served to protect the landscape, leaving it largely unchanged for the last 150 years. The time you spend here will allow you to witness the significance of this place and see how the early conflicts and the harsh experiences on the frontier saw, out of adversity, the creation of the Australian bush legend. The nature of pastoralism and the isolation of this location allowed the reputation of the abilities of the Australian stockman to develop and, in this preserved landscape, you will capture this sense of history and experience the unique and beautiful untamed Australian bush."
5051460,Hill End Historic Site,"By mid 1851, alluvial gold was first found in the Hill End goldfields. The population of Hill End exploded following these early discoveries and, by the second rush in 1872, it was the largest inland settlement in the NSW colony. One of the most remarkable things about Hill End now is the virtual lack of development since the gold rush with almost all of the buildings dating back to the boom years around 1872 and it is this unique collection of buildings, relics, artefacts, structures, archaeological sites and landscape elements which are, individually and collectively, of outstanding architectural, aesthetic and research value."
5051461,"Old Great North Road, Between Devine's Hill and Mount Manning","The Great North Road runs from the Windsor Road in Baulkham Hills to Wiseman's Ferry where it branches off to Maitland and Singleton. The Old Great North Road, over 240 km long, embodies much of the thinking of the early colonial society. Its magnificent structures were powerful, tangible symbols of the colony's perceived place and role in the course of empire, unmistakable evidence that the civilised state was being attained and a triumph over a rugged and inhospitable landscape.  The physical construction of the Old Great North Road was completed by convict road gangs between 1826 and 1834 and it still remains one of the major engineering feats of the convict era. Much of the road is still in use today and there are well-preserved sections of the original road that demonstrate the skill of the original construction. The 43km section immediately north of Wiseman's Ferry, from Devine's Hill to Mount Manning run through very steep and rugged country and contains particularly fine examples of high walling with massive buttresses, drainage systems and quarries. The walls, up to 13m high, are made of interlocking stone blocks of varying shapes and sizes without mortar to hold them together. Some of the blocks weigh up to 660 kg!"
5051462,Parramatta Park and Old Government House,"Parramatta Park demonstrates the continuous cultivation and use of the land, originally by the Burramatta clan of the Dharug Aboriginal people and later through the processes of colonisation. It was also here, beside the river in 1788, that the first farm was established to produce sufficient food to feed the penal colony, saving the settlement from starvation.  The construction of Old Government House at Parramatta also demonstrates the growth of the colony, from an impermanent cottage, built with the limited material available, into a grand residence with some of the finest extant plaster and joinery from the Georgian period.  A landmark site, the park and house retains historical association with successive governors, and was the location for significant interaction between Aboriginal and European people. It demonstrates early town planning and landscaping design and features strategic and picturesque views and vistas, created to frame Old Government House and enforce the status of the Governor over the convicts and free settlers inhabiting the township below. As such it is a conscious recreation of English landscapes of control."
5051466,Woronora Dam,"Woronora Dam is testimony to the ability of a government body to systematically harness a natural resource for utilitarian purposes. Woronora Dam is a unique element within the Sydney water system as it exists independently of the collection and storage dams of the Upper Nepean-Warragamba schemes and supplies only the southern suburbs of the metropolitan area, including Sutherland, Cronulla, and Heathcote. Woronora Village, located within the Dam curtilage, has historical significance as a township founded for the sole purpose of accomodating construction workers and their families, and shares architectural and planning characteristics with the villages of the Upper Nepean and Warramgamba schemes."
5051468,Avon Dam,"The Avon Dam, officially opened in 1928, is the third of the four water supply dams in the Metropolitan Catchment constructed to provide a secure water supply to satisfy the demands of industrial, commercial residential development of metropolitan Sydney up to circa 1960. The dam at the time of its construction held the largest area of impounded water in the Sydney water supply system and, at 200 feet (61 m) high from foundation level, was the second highest dam in New South Wales at the time.  The setting of the dam within the native bushland of catchment is also one of the most attractive of the Metropolitan dams and, as an early and large example of the spillway of the Dam dramatically cutting through the saddle of the hillside, the scale of this undertaking in its depth and width continues to impress the contemporary viewer."
5051469,Cataract Dam,"Completed in 1907, the Cataract Dam was the first of the four water supply dams in the Metropolitan Catchment Area constructed to provide a secure water supply to satisfy the demands of industrial, commercial and residential development of metropolitan Sydney up to circa1960.  The dam contains in-situ items of Federation era water delivery technologies developed by the Public Works Department that are unique such as the lenghts of iron discharge pipes, and system of penstocks, and valve tower water inlet system. The site of the Cataract Dam also contains a number of resident maintenance men's cottages and a residence used by board members of the Water Board that collectively continue to evoke the manner in which the dam was maintained and emphasise the importance of the dam to successive generations of management of the Water Board.  The setting of the dam's picnic grounds within the plantations of pine trees amidst native bushland of the catchment, make the Cataract Dam one of the most attractive of the Metropolitan Dams to visit."
5051470,Cordeaux Dam,"Officially opened in 1927, the Cordeaux is the second of the four water supply dams in the Metropolitan Catchment constructed to provide a secure water supply to satisfy the demands of industrial, commercial and residential development of metropolitan Sydney up to circa 1960.  The dam contains in-situ items of Inter War era water delivery technologies developed by the Public Works Department, such as lengths of cast iron discharge pipes, and penstocks which in consideration of their scale and integrity are rare examples of their types. The roller emergency gates, multiple level discharge intakes, curtain grouting, contraction joints, and inspection galleries are the first examples of their type in NSW.  The setting of the dam's upper picnic grounds within the native bushland of the catchment is one of the most attractive of the Metropolitan Dams. The dam is a landmark that has engendered beautification works undertaken in the 1920s and again in the 1960s for the general visiting public through the picnic areas."
5051477,Nepean Dam,"The Nepean Dam, constructed between 1903 and 1936, is the fourth and last of the water supply dams in the Metropolitan Catchment to provide a secure water supply to satisfy the demands of industrial, commercial and residential development of metropolitan Sydney up circa 1960.  The dam contains in-situ items of Inter-War era water delivery technologies developed by the Public Works Department, such as lengths of iron discharge pipes, roller gates and penstocks, which in consideration of their scale and integrity are rare examples of their types. The electric lift service is the first example of its type in a dam in New South Wales.  The site of the Nepean Dam contains remnants of the construction platforms, roadways blasted out of the hillside for plant and machinery, the site of the township specifically established for the construction of the dam, a purpose built tramway, and two Public Works Department's cottages that collectively continue to evoke the era of the dam's construction, which in consideration of the scale and permanent nature of the works represent a landmark in civil engineering practice.  The dam is a regional landmark that has engendered beautification works undertaken in the 1930s and again from the 1950s for the general visiting public."
5051483,Warragamba Dam - Haviland Park,"Located in the Haviland Park, the Warragamba Dam represents the pinnacle of quality visitor facilities provided by the Board at Dam sites. It displays a high degree of formality and planning and is rich in both exotic and native botanical species which contribute to the landscape significance of the park. It commemorates the role of Haviland, without whom the numerous landscaped parks and reserves of the Dams would not have been established, nor execuated with such high regard for design and formalism. It is highly valued by the community of New South Wales as a place for passive recreation, leisure activities and sightseeing pursuits."
5051484,Warragamba Emergency Scheme,"The Warragamba Emergency Scheme is representative of the collective engineering response to Sydney's critical water shortage during the Second World War period. It was the first stage in the storage and extraction of water from the Warragamba River, and was preliminary to the Waragamba Dam. All of the components are excellent examples of the civil engineering skills of the times; the Balance Reservoir is particulary significant because it provides a stilling pool downstream of Warragamba Dam for the purpose of flood discharge; the group of five cottages associated with the construction of the dam are considered to be of high significance because they housed the operations staff between 1940 and 1959. These have since been incorporated into the Warragamba township, one of the largest townships in the Shire of Wollondilly."
5051488,NSW Fire Brigades No 10 Vehicle Number Plates,"Explore the drama and danger of fire and fire fighting at the largest Museum of Fire in Australia.  Explore the history of fighting fires from the earliest times right up to the challenges of present day fires.  The museum is also the leading fire safety education facility in the country, so not only will you have fun exploring the history of fire fighting but you will also learn what to do if there is a fire!"
5051503,High Conservation Value Old Growth Forest,"The Old Growth Forest in the New England Tablelands is of significance to us all as a beautiful, unspoilt remnant of New South Wales' natural heritage. Explore the beauty of the Australian bush in one of the following National Parks or Reserves: 1.   Bald Rock National Park 2.   Basket Swamp National Park 3.   Boonoo Boonoo National Park 4.

Werrikimbe National Park"
5051506,North Sydney Post Office,"Learn about the early days of the postal service in North Sydney on the North Sydney Post Office to Waverton Heritage Walk, produced by the North Shore Historical Society. The North Sydney Post Office is associated with the development of communication and postal services in the North Sydney area from 1854 and, as such, the current Post Office is associated with the growth of the area during the mid-nineteenth century.  North Sydney Post Office is aesthetically significant because it is a distinctive example of the Victorian Free Classical style, with strong visual appeal. It is located on a prominent corner site and makes a significant contribution to the streetscape of the North Sydney civic precinct and, along with the adjoining Court House and Police Station, provides an insight in the earlier built form of the North Sydney CDB."
5051524,Gore Hill Memorial Cemetery,"Wandering around a cemetery can be a fascinating way to spend an afternoon. The Gore Hill Memorial Cemetery was established in 1868 and, by virtue of its design and historical associations, it is an important place in the pattern of the cultural history of NSW. In its layout, monuments and plants it demonstrates the religious philosophies and changing attitudes to death and its commemoration by a significant sample of the Australian population over a period of more than 100 years.  Aesthetically, the cemetery is a rare and representative example of a particularly fine and intact Late Victorian/Edwardian landscaped public burial ground with landmark qualities, important plantings and a wealth of high quality funerary architecture demonstrating the skills of the artisans who crafted the monuments. Occasional tours are run so it is well worth contacting the Willoughby City Council."
5051536,Camden Park Estate and Belgenny Farm,"Belgenny Farm was the working farm supporting the Camden Park homestead. Collectively they form the oldest, intact, rural landscape and group of farm buildings in Australia, with close associations with the Macarthur family. Belgenny Farm and Camden Park Estate were instrumental and influential in the development of Australia’s agricultural, pastoral, horticultural and viticultural industries. They represent the evolution of many rural industrial technologies and a rare example of a remnant colonial farm of the Cumberland Plain. Belgenny Farm offers tours on selected days, hire for weddings and conferences.  Camden Park House is a private property but opens on occasion for public viewing."
5051540,Gledswood,"Gledswood is an early 19th century farm estate, built by James Chisholm in 1830. It has an outstanding colonial garden that was expanded in 1870. Gledswood has historical significance for its association with the early development of Australia's wine industry. Gledswood offers tours, hire for weddings and conferences."
5051545,Sydney Observatory,"Built in 1858, this picturesque Italianate Observatory is of exceptional significance for its range of changing uses over two centuries, including milling (the first windmill); defence (the first, and still extant, fort fabric); communications (the flagstaffs, first semaphore and first electric telegraph connection); astronomy, meteorology and time keeping. As an example of a Colonial building erected for scientific purposes and astronomical observations, and continuing to perform this function at the present time, the Observatory and the survival of astronomical instruments, equipment and some early furniture, although temporarily dispersed, and the retention of most interior spaces, joinery, plasterwork, fireplaces, and supports ensure that the Observatory can remain the most intact and longest serving early scientific building in the State. The elevation of the site, with its harbour and city views and vistas framed by mature Moreton Bay figs, also make it one of the most pleasant and spectacular locations in Sydney."
5051559,Grave of Yuranigh,"The gravesite of Yuranigh, a guide to Sir Thomas Mitchell on his famous last north west exploratory adventure, is an excellent example of 'culture contact'. The presence of carved trees around the grave demonstrates the commemoration by Aboriginal people, while the inscribed headstone indicates the tribute for courage, honesty and fidelity bestowed on Yuranigh by Major Mitchell. The carved trees are also, as far as is known, the longest remaining number of carved trees around a grave."
5051578,Jenolan Caves Reserve,"Since its reported discovery by James Whalan between 1838 and 1841, the Jenolan Caves Reserve has become one of the most important natural heritage areas in Australia. The area includes one of the largest and most beautiful interconnected cave systems in Australia and is an outstanding site of geological and speleological interest. The reserve developed as an important scientific and tourist destination throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, and it is highly significant as the first public reserve set aside in NSW for the protection of a natural resource. Alongside the   aesthetic qualities of the caves and cave formations, the setting of the reserve in a native bush environment contribute significantly to the beautiful and distinctive landscape of this site."
5051584,Great Synagogue,"The Great Synagogue is the earliest surviving synagogue in NSW still in use, which has represented the centre of Jewish worship and culture in central Sydney since the 1870s. As a major landmark of Sydney, the Great Synagogue is is the only high Victorian style synagogue in Australia and represents one of the most elaborately decorated Victorian buildings in Sydney, internally and externally.The Great Synagogue is associated with the Mother Congregation of Australian Jewry, together with many subsequent leading members and families of the Jewish faith. By its prominent situation and presence in Central Sydney, its magnificent architectural grandeur, its rich symbolism, and its important collection of Hebrew documents and other religious artefacts, the Great Synagogue also embodies and demonstrates the early development and importance of the Jewish faith and culture in New South Wales during the 19th Century."
5051590,Ben Chifley's House,"Ben Chifley's cottage was the home of the former Prime Minister of Australia (1945-1949). After Ben Chifley was elected to parliament, he continued to be involved in the local council and retained his home in Bathurst where his wife Elizabeth stayed when he was away in Canberra. Although the home contains memorabilia of Ben Chifley's years in office as Prime Minister of Australia, it also retains the simple furnishings that demonstrated the lifestyle and projected image of Chifley as a ‘plain man’."
5051812,Bathurst Showground (Draft),"There is nothing like the excitement of the Bathurst Show, held at the beginning of March each year. See the best cattle, horses, sheep and poultry in the region and get a thrill from all the rides but, while enjoying the show, take note of the buildings that surround you. The landscaped setting and high architectural qualities of these buildings have great heritage significance and they have become important landmarks in the community since they were built in the 19th century."
5051846,Denison Bridge,"Marvel at the technological achievements of the 1870s as you view the Denison Bridge. The bridge is the second oldest metal truss bridge remaining in New South Wales and its advanced design was a major engineering achievement at the time and represents the maximum achievable by truss spans. Spanning the Macquarie River at Kelso, the bridge is a prominent local landmark that is now decorated with flags denoting events celebrated in the town."
5052348,Roxy Community Theatre,"The Roxy Community Theatre is a rare surviving example of an Inter-war Art Deco cinema in country NSW from the heyday era of movies. Opened in 1930, this theatre demonstrates the importance of 'cinema going' during the first half of the 20th century in NSW towns before the advent of television. It also demonstrates and records the early introduction of American pop culture into country NSW by the early Hollywood movies shown for the first time in this cinema, by the building function, original theatrical design and its name, which were all modelled on the world's largest showcase movie palace of the time, the original Roxy Theatre in New York of 1927. This early introduction of American pop culture in the form of Hollywood movies and picture theatres, provided a major new form of entertainment, communication and society to NSW communities, as well as having a significant influence on Australian tastes of the time in architecture, fashion and design generally, language, music and behaviour.      Films are still screened on Friday and Saturday nights, with matinees during school holidays, and tours of the theatre are available on request."
5052361,Hill 60/ Illowra Battery,"A narrow but established walking track guides you to the summit of Hill 60 and, from there, the lookout affords you spectacular views up and down the coast. Down on the beach below are an array of Aboriginal archaeological remains that demonstrate the evolving pattern of Aboriginal cultural history and the Aboriginal land rights struggle in the region. The artefacts, including the shell middens, are rare on the NSW coast. The Hill was also tunnelled and fitted with guns during World War II to protect Port Kembla and, although the guns have been removed, the concrete bunkers still remain."
5052418,Collingwood,"Collingwood House Estate is a remnant cultural landscape that demonstrates the changing use and occupation of the site and the significant transition of the place from an agricultural estate to an industrial estate during the 19th century. Originally known as Bunker's Farm, this estate was one of the earliest and largest land grants in the region, which played an important role in the development of agriculture and early industries in the colony. The house complex is a rare example of modified colonial Georgian residence that demonstrates the evolution of domestic colonial architecture and its adaptation to the Australian environment from the early 1800s to the 1860s. It is one of only a small number of houses that remain from the Macquarie period, and one of the earliest examples conforming to the strict building code relating to materials, form, dimensions and siting decreed by Governor Macquarie on 26 December, 1810. The evolution of the house in terms of its fabric, dimensions and layout, is also illustrative of the social and economic standing of its various owners within the colony, their resources, and the genteel lifestyle to which they aspired."
5052600,St. Lukes Anglican Church Gulgong,
5052602,"Holy Trinity Anglican Church, Orange",
5052604,Old Government Cottages Group,"Run by the Bathurst District Historical Society, the museum exhibits a range of historical artefacts and displays a wealth of information for local people and visitors to share alike. In addition to learning about the Bathurst area, you can also access the extensive archival material to research your own history, available for a small search and printing fee."
5052762,"Hambledon Cottage, Grounds and Archaeology","Hambledon Cottage was built by John Macarthur in 1824 as a second house on his Elizabeth Farm Estate. It has had many occupants, but the most notable was Penelope Lucas, former governess to Macarthur's daughters.  She named the family ""Cottage"" after the township of Hambledon in Hampshire, England.   Hambledon Cottage is built of rendered sandstock brick in the Colonial Georgian style, the joinery throughout is of Australian cedar and is a splendid example of fine Georgian detailing.  Some of the internal ceilings and walls are still of lath and plaster whilst one bedroom still has its original ironbark floor.  An excellent example of a domed brick oven adjoins the open fireplace in the kitchen.  The cottage is tastefully furnished in the style of the times."
5052822,Linnwood,"Linnwood, including its associated buildings and landscape, is significant as a site that has been in operation and use for over 80 years. Since 1917, the site was continually adapted and developed specifically for various welfare uses such as housing and educating state wards. Of particular significance is the use of Linnwood as the first and only Truant School that was in existence in NSW between 1917 and 1936 and was later used by the Department of Welfare as a Girls Home Science Domestic School for state wards.  Linwood is also significant as an example of a prominent and wealthy city businessman's country retreat that was constructed on a large estate beyond the then outskirts of Sydney. The size and fine detail of this late Victorian residence demonstrates the wealth, aspirations and lifestyle of this class in society. To view this important home, you can contact the Friends of Linnwood who run tours by appointment and have a calander of events on offer."
5052855,Old Cowra Grandstand - Cowra Showground,
5052865,St. Thomas' Anglican Church,"During your visit to Port Macquarie you will be drawn to St Thomas' Anglican Church, which is one of the earliest examples of its type in Australia.  Built by convict labour by 1827, this church demonstrates the longevity of the Anglican faith in the Port Macquaries area and Hastings Valley region since the area was established as a secondary convict settlement in 1821."
5052983,North Beach Precinct,"The North Beach Precinct is significant for demonstrating the recreational role played by surfing and beach culture during the twentieth century in coastal NSW in conjunction with important remnants of the industrial heritage of Wollongong. The North Beach Bathing Pavilion and Kiosk are relatively intact examples of the Interwar Functionalist style of architecture, a rare style for these types of buildings, and they have a strong aesthetic relationship to each other. The tramway cutting is a significant reminder of the days when coal was transported from Mount Pleasant through North Beach to Wollongong Harbour.  It is rare to find this conjunction of seaside architecture and industrial remnants/archaeology in such close proximity. The site is also of high local significance for its landmark Inter-war seaside buildings within the Illawarra region and for the historical, cultural and social associations of the place within the Wollongong community."
5052989,Rail Motor Collection,"A visit to this small, private museum is well worth the effort. The collection is made up of an assortment of 9 Rail Motors and 2 Rail Motor Trailers but the jewel of the collection are the CPH class rail motors, the first motors to break the monopoly of steam trains. The collection also contains rail motors and trailers that are the last surviving examples of their type."
5052993,Berry Courthouse,"The Berry Courthouse operated as a courthouse from 1891 to 1988 and, as such, reflects the early history of governance and law and order in the region and NSW. As an example of a small scale rural courthouse designed in the Classical Academic style, its fine, elegant design embodies  late 19th century concepts of courthouse architecture. Set in its distinctive landscape it is composed as an imposing and austere structure, a land mark for the township which announces its function as the centre of justice in the township."
5053088,Bathurst Old School of Arts Library Collection,"This movable heritage collection of an estimated 2000 books is significant as the core collection of reference and historic books held by the Bathurst School of Arts between 1855 and 1956. The collection, dating from 1760 with an emphasis on nineteenth century texts about Australia, includes rare and valuable volumes but also provides historic insights into the information available to the inhabitants of the major Bathurst regional centre. The collection has research potential for scholars studying regional Australian history of the period, the School of Arts movement in NSW and the historical workings of local libraries. The collection is available by appointment only and the Bathurst Library should be contacted for details."
5053114,Dawes Point Battery remains,"The post-1788 archaeological remains at the Dawes Point Battery are exceedingly rare, with the remains of First Government House and parts of the Dockyard on the western side of the Cove being some of the few examples bearing witness to the first 10 years of white settlement at Sydney Cove. The 1789 Foundation Stone (now with the Mitchell Collection in the NSW State Library) and the five 1850s cannon on their upper gun carriages contribute strongly to the heritage significance of the place, in addition to being significant in their own right. As a place, Dawes Point is important for its cultural values to several identifiable groups within NSW society including present and former residents of the Rocks and Millers Point; people involved in the fight to save the Rocks in the 1970s; descendants of the many artillerymen and their families who were stationed at Dawes Point; and Bridge construction and maintenance workers, their families and descendants. Dawes Point, as a setting for the Harbour Bridge, is valued for its aesthetic and engineering significance by several identifiable groups including the Institution of Engineers (Australia) and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects."
5053122,Morpeth Courthouse (former),
5053135,New Italy Settlement,"The New Italy Settlement Landscape is evidence of a settlement built through the tenacity, forbearance and technical skills of a unique group of Australian settlers. This museum complex now stands as a vibrant and living monument to the important contributions made by these (and other) Italian migrants to the past and present cultural and social identity of the North Coast region and the whole state of NSW. Moreover the museum complex is a continuing celebration of multicultural Australia and the important links forged between the Italian and wider Australian community. The ongoing patronage of the site by Italian and non-Italian local and state dignitaries is evidence of the esteem in which the heritage of New Italy is held by the broader community.  The complex includes a museum, cafe and restaurant as well as the Gurrigai Aboriginal Arts and Crafts Gallery."
5053136,Accountants House,"The Rocks is a unique and special historical precinct where you will be transported back in time. As you wander the streets you will be impressed by the historic buildings, including Accountants House. Built in 1914 in a modest Federation Warehouse style, much of the original timber structure of the interior and the Art Deco styled refurbishment in this building, including the main stair and lift, remains intact. The scale, form, use of materials and detailing of the building makes a positive contribution to the intact 19th and early 20th century streetscapes of the The Rocks and the building provides evidence of early endeavours to encourage planned development in the area after The Rocks had been resumed by a government instrumentality in the early 20th century."
5053138,Argyle Cut,"The Rocks is a unique historical precinct where you will be transported back in time and, as you wander the streets, you will be impressed by many of the sights, including the Argyle Cut. The Cut was begun with convict labour in 1843 to provide direct easy access between Millers Point and The Rocks but was not completed until 1859, with the use of explosives and council labour. Today, the Argyle Cut is an imposing but aesthetic example of convict public works that still provides a dramatic crossing through The Rocks."
5053139,Argyle Stores,"The Argyle Stores demonstrate the early history of Sydney by including the substantial remains of one the earliest surviving commercial buildings in Sydney, dating from c1826, as well as one of the earliest surviving building occupied for use as a Customs House from 1830 until 1850. The group of buildings is probably unique in Sydney in its ability to demonstrate changing warehouse design and construction from the early 19th to the early 20th century and, despite numerous alterations, the buildings still retain much of the fabric of their major phases of development and use as commercial stores. These buildings are believed to be among the first historic buildings in NSW to be recycled for new uses in a way designed to respect the earlier historical significance of the site, and therefore represent and important landmark in the history of conservation. The buildings provide clear evidence of early conservation practice and philosophy."
5053140,Argyle Terrace - Caminetto's Restaurant,"Built in 1883, this pair of terraces are a representative, but slightly more elaborate, example of typical workers housing being built for the rental market during the mid-Victorian period in Sydney, in an area including other retail and commercial uses. The terraces demonstrate clearly the stages of development of this group and the typical subdivision patterns which occurred during the period 1875-1883. Together with the adjacent terraces, they formed part of the first residential restoration/revitalisation project undertaken by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority in the 1970s."
5053141,ASN Co Building,"The Australian Steam Navigation Building, constructed in 1884 in the rare Pre-Federation Anglo Dutch architectural style, is a piece of artwork in its own right! It is a very rare and fine Victorian example of an office and warehouse development in Sydney, and with its prominent waterfront location, the Australian Steam Navigation Building is the perfect venue to view the colourful and vibrant works of the world famous Australian artist, Ken Done."
5053143,Australian Hotel,"The Rocks is a unique and special historical precinct where you will be transported back in time. As you wander the streets you will be impressed by the historic buildings, including Australian Hotel. This 1914 building is an embodiment of the two-storey scale of the area which predominated in the pre-Bridge era. The history of the building, and the rare two-level bar, is a record of social history including the drinking habits of the time and the economic vagaries of society (by virtue of its success during economic hardship and during wartime stringencies). The building is a rare and virtually intact example of hotel and shops combined in the one architectural treatment and the residences above the shops are an important reminder of a past practice of combining living and working premises."
5053148,Brooklyn Hotel,"The Brooklyn Hotel is an important example for its 1912 facade and shopfront, which are typical of the period. The top verandah is interesting in a picturesque manner flanked by two Ionic columns and the whole facade has high quality stone detailing. The awning forms an important part of this composition and the shopfront below, which is probably contemporary with the building, is unique. The interiors of the ground and first floor bars are also significant and well designed for their purpose."
5053151,Campbell's Stores,"Built in 1839, Campbell's Stores is a superb example of mid-nineteenth century warehouse buildings, now the only surviving warehouses of their type remaining on the foreshores of Sydney Cove, formerly the hub of commerce and international shipping transport until the late nineteenth century. The Campbell's Stores is a complex of sandstone buildings which provide a stunning forefront to The Rocks from the Sydney Opera House but, a far cry from its days as storage, Campbell's Stores now houses prestigious restaurants!"
5053153,Cleland Bond Store (part of Argyle Stores),"The Argyle Stores demonstrate the early history of Sydney by including the substantial remains of one the earliest surviving commercial buildings in Sydney, dating from c1826, as well as one of the earliest surviving building occupied for use as a Customs House from 1830 until 1850. The group of buildings is probably unique in Sydney in its ability to demonstrate changing warehouse design and construction from the early 19th to the early 20th century and, despite numerous alterations, the buildings still retain much of the fabric of their major phases of development and use as commercial stores. These buildings are believed to be among the first historic buildings in NSW to be recycled for new uses in a way designed to respect the earlier historical significance of the site, and therefore represent and important landmark in the history of conservation. The buildings provide clear evidence of early conservation practice and philosophy."
5053154,Coach House,"The Coach House is a rare surviving example of a large stable with stores and workshops above in Sydney, dating from 1853. Historically, the Coach House was part of the industrial nature of The Rocks and makes up part of The Rocks, an area that conveys very clearly the character of Sydney's mid to late 19th century period of development.  The exterior and interiors of the building are aestheticly important which still retain many original or later finishes and fixtures demonstrate its original industrial nature. The late nineteenth century catshead beam and pulley are also rare surviving examples in their original location."
5053156,Coroner's Court (former) - Shops & offices,"Built in 1906, the Coroner's Court is the earliest surviving purpose-built Coroner's Court in NSW (and the only constructed before 1970), and as such has a unique ability to demonstrate, through its external appearance and internal layout and fabric, the history of the Coroner's office and of Coronial inquests. The survival of this building also provides the only remaining evidence of the site's association with early colonial methods of dealing with the investigation of unexplained or sudden deaths, over a continuous period from 1854 to 1971.  In conjunction with the other structures of similar date near that location, the Coroner’s Court also provides evidence of the new buildings constructed in the Rocks area after the area was taken over by the Sydney Harbour Trust."
5053157,Cumberland Place and Steps,"The Rocks, since the earliest days of settlement, has been characterised by the steep streets and laneways running east to west across the rocky promontory and Cumberland Place and Steps is one of those rare places where you can feel history. As a thoroughfare from Harrington to Cumberland Street, comprising a series of flights of steps and landings, Cumberland Place and Steps is of cultural significance as one such accessway still in existence, to a large extent, as evidenced from c1900 photographs and documented in early maps."
5053160,English Scottish & Auastralian Chartered Bank (former) - Amo Roma Restaurant,"Amo Roma serves Italian-inspired cuisine in a modern and stylish atmosphere, all contained behind the Gothic sandstone of the former English, Scotish & Australian Chartered Bank (ES&AC Bank). This building shows evidence of the significant human activities of commerce, land tenure and leisure, and is associated with several significant historical events including: early colonial settlement, 1880's Boom economy, the Bank Crash of 1893, the outbreak of Bubonic Plague of 1900, the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Green Bans movement of the 1960s/70s. The primary significance of this site stems from it being designed by prominent architect William Wilkinson Wardell. It is the only known surviving example of a stone Gothic Revival bank building designed by Wardell in NSW. The building is significant as it demonstrates Wardell's individual interpretation of the Gothic Revival style at a time when eclecticism and historicist approach to design was prominent. Tempted? You should be."
5053161,"Evans' Stores, Harbour Rocks Hotel","The site of the Harbour Rocks Hotel is of historical significance as part of the original hospital garden, and of subsequent buildings, from 1850 until the construction of the Evans' Stores in 1890. The Evans' Stores demonstrates the nineteenth century mercantile/commercial built form of The Rocks and the surviving building has aesthetic significance as an unusual and imposing three-storey brick warehouse, an important visual feature in Harrington Street,."
5053163,Fortune of War Hotel,"The Fortune of War Hotel is a three-storey facebrick building with stucco detailing, built in 1922. The façade of this building shows the Californian Bungalow style as applied to a commercial hotel building, employing the robust brick architecture typical of the 1920/30s. The building makes a positive contribution to the general streetscape and it remains relatively intact in its presentation to the street, retaining original features such as wall tiles, face brick, rendered trim and other features. Internally, the main public areas also retain much of their original form and detail, including the wall tile, bar and other joinery."
5053164,Gannon House & Shop,"The buildings, that house the Gannon House Gallery, are important as evidence of the early architectural development of The Rocks district and No.45, in particular, is a valuable and significantly complete residence of that period, retaining most of its original internal fabric and detail. They both have architectural and historic importance for their design qualities, construction and associations and make a significant individual contribution to the rich townscape of The Rocks."
5053165,Glenmore Hotel,"Since 1921, the Glenmore Hotel has been a Sydney icon that represents the post-plague rebuilding era in The Rocks. It is a well-preserved example of a small one bar hotel, embodying Australia's changing drinking habits by the gradual expansion of the public bar drinking facilities and the gradual reduction of 'genteel' drinking in the parlours. The hotel is one of the last, purpose-built pre-World War II hotels in the Rocks still remaining and, as such, represents a change of emphasis by the breweries in pursuing markets away from the declining inner city areas."
5053169,Jobbins Terrace,"Jobbins Terrace is primarily significant as a unique ensemble of nineteenth century residential buildings, laneways and rear yards in The Rocks, including examples from the Early Victorian, Victorian, and Edwardian architectural periods. The Terrace is also significant because it retains rare examples of early-nineteenth century public laneways in their original scale and orientation. Part of the Terrace, Carahers Lane, is a rare documented site where the existence of slum housing from the-mid to late-nineteenth century can be shown to be associated with the remaining physical fabric, and historical documentation about the landlords/owners."
5053174,Mariners' Church,"Built in 1856, the former Mariners' Church is associated with the Age of Victorian enlightenment, reflected in the establishment of the Bethel Union and Rawson Institute for Seamen, and in changes in approaches to the welfare of seamen evidenced by the building fabric. The existing Mariners' Church complex is an important streetscape element in a major historic precinct and its buildings display characteristics of the highest aesthetic calibre, including fine details and use of two applications of the Free Classical style - one early Victorian, the other Federation. The fabric of the Mariners' Church evidences high quality workmanship and early use of steel technology and illustrates subsequent application of conservation values and principles."
5053175,Mercantile Hotel,"The Mercantile Hotel is historically important as one of the more intact survivors of The Rocks late 19th and early 20th century pubs, having operated continuously since its opening in 1914 and retaining much of its original character, fabrics and functions. It is also the first and only major building to occupy this key site within The Rocks, the dramatic stone-walled excavation line along the west boundary providing a vivid reminder of the original physical character of both site and The Rocks as a whole.  The Hotel has significant associations with the early maritime and mercantile activity in The Rocks through its location close to key early wharves and warehouses, its provision of public house services to local workers and their families and its origins as replacement for the original Mercantile Rowing Club Hotel following this building's demolition in 1914.  The Hotel is a simply but competently detailed example of Federation Free Style architecture and the three-storey building retains important components of its original internal fabric and layout which contribute to its role as an exemplar of its particular style, period and architectural design.  Socially, the Hotel is of importance to its regular clientele as ""their local pub"". Its location, character and continuity of service making it a recognisable fixture in the local area and its more recent use, as a venue for Irish music, has also established a wider and more specifically focused local identity, reflected in the memorabilia of featured guest artists on display in the bar."
5053176,Merchants House,"This building is the most intact example of the typical late Georgian period townhouse and the last one of its kind known to survive in NSW. This building reflects the wealth and status of the small business and merchant class of 19th century Sydney and provides evidence of the once dominant mercantile nature of The Rocks. It is an extremely valuable resource for understanding life in the area, especially if examined along with Michael Gannon’s house in Argyle Street and Susannah Place in Gloucester Street which represent contrasting socio-economic backgrounds. Built in 1848, the five-level Merchant House still contains many original elements as well as a rare example, in Sydney, of an intact mid-nineteenth century first floor drawing room with its moulded plasterwork, chimney piece and grate, joinery, and cantilevered balcony."
5053177,Metcalfe Bond Stores,"The Metcalfe Bond Stores, comprising two adjacent buildings that were both constructed in the functionalist tradition, have landmark significance as part of the important early 20th century townscape in The Rocks. The conversion of these stores to shops and offices in 1973, while still maintaining their warehouse atmosphere, also demonstrates the developing attitudes to conservation philosophy and heritage practice of the period."
5053181,Observer Hotel,"The Observer Hotel demonstrates the rebuilding of The Rocks in the post-plague era and, despite a number of alterations, this 1908 Federation Free Style hotel is a well-preserved and remarkably intact example of a small, one bar, hotel."
5053182,Old Sydney Holiday Inn,"Harrington's Buildings, now the northern part of the Old Sydney Park Royal Inn, is significant as one of a large number of warehouses built in The Rocks. Due to the close proximity of the wharf facilities, the site was originally part of an 1816 land grant but the warehouse, built in the Industrial Edwardian architectural style, currently on the site was not built until 1924. Since this period however, this building has become a landmark in the area and it is a place that now exudes a clever combination of elegance and historic charm."
5053183,Orient Hotel,"The Orient Hotel, built in 1843, is one of the oldest such buildings remaining in this part of The Rocks. The importance of the Orient Hotel arises from its early links with the initial settlement in Sydney and early subdivision within The Rocks; its continuous use as a hotel, making it amongst the oldest continuous licensed premises in Sydney; it is evidence of the continuous and changing roles of hotels from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day in the city of Sydney; and it is an important feature in the historically significant streetscape, especially as a corner element in the neighbourhood."
5053185,Playfair Street Terraces,"Let one of the oldest walking tour companies guide you around one of the oldest areas of Australia. The Rocks Walking Tours operates from the Playfair Street Terraces, built in 1875 for the working-class rental market.

Tours run daily and groups can be catered for."
5053189,Reynolds's Cottages,"Reynold’s Cottages, at Nos 28-30 Harrington Street, were built in 1830 and are two of the oldest surviving dwellings in The Rocks. They are also one of the rare examples of small scale Colonial Georgian architecture to be found in Sydney. The surviving buildings reflect the utilitarian function of the early dwellings in The Rocks and they demonstrate the use and range of nineteenth century building techniques and materials, illustrating a dramatic change in the standard and quality of work of this time.  The views from the rear courtyard are also of aesthetic significance and you can experience these views while enjoying a meal at the bustling Gumnut Tree Garden."
5053191,Russell Hotel and shop,"The Russell Hotel and shop, built in 1887, is a unique example of a late nineteenth century Federation Queen Anne style hotel in the Sydney CBD. The building's picturesque Scottish baronial tower boldly marks the corner of George and Globe Streets, contributing to the landmark value of the building in The Rocks. The building remains relatively intact, retaining significant original architectural features and much of the original internal layout and details. Today, the Russell is a small boutique hotel that can offer the personalised hospitality that escapes larger hotels. While maintaining the charm and elegance of its 19th century beginnings, the Russell Hotel has all the conveniences the modern traveller has come to expect."
5053192,Sailor's Home (former),"The Rocks Self-Guided Walking Tour has been specially designed to give you an insight into this unique area of Sydney. Saved from the bulldozers in the 1970s, The Rocks area is a fun place to explore, with many narrow lanes lined with colonial houses, shops and warehouses, some of which have been converted into delightful cafes, restaurants and specialty shops. Take a day to wander around this charming historic precinct, and on your way, you will discover the former Sailor's Home that now holds the Sailor's Thai restaurant. The Sailor's Home was built in the 1860s as cheap, clean accommodation for sailors. In the 1980s a Marionette Theatre briefly occupied the building and just lately a Visitors Centre, as well as the restaurant."
5053193,Samson's Cottage (wall remains),"The Rocks Self-Guided Walking Tour has been specially designed to give you an insight into this unique area of Sydney. Saved from the bulldozers in the 1970s, The Rocks area is a fun place to explore, with many narrow lanes lined with colonial houses, shops and warehouses, some of which have been converted into delightful cafes, restaurants and specialty shops. Take a day to wander around this charming historic precinct and, on your way, you will discover Samson's Cottage. The original two-storey 1844 cottage was partly demolished but the remaining walls portray extremely well the development of the site and adjoining property in a rare visual cut away section."
5053196,Shop - Phillip's Foote Restaurant,"Now home to the warm and relaxed Phillip's Foote restaurant, this building is steeped in its heritage. Built in 1838, this two-storey Victorian Regency building is a simple shop and residence that has had various uses throughout its history, each adding to its historical significance.

To experience his trend-setting and inspirational work, visit the Ken Duncan gallery in The Rocks, located in a late Art Nouveau building. Constructed in 1842, this building retains the potential for its return to its near original configuration and street appearance to complement the highly significant nineteenth-century townscape precinct in George Street."
5053206,"Shop, Rockpool Restaurant","The Rocks is now full of fine dining venues but the flag-ship Rockpool is arguably one of the best.

Have you ever wanted to visit Antarctica? You can!"
5053228,Terraces/Harbour Rocks Hotel,"The site of the Harbour Rocks Hotel is of historical significance as part of the original hospital garden, and of subsequent buildings from 1850 until the construction of the Evans' Stores in 1890. The Evans' Stores demonstrates the nineteenth century mercantile/commercial built form of The Rocks and the building is an unusual and imposing three-storey warehouse which still forms an important visual element in the historic precinct of The Rocks. This charming heritage building was built by twelve convict carpenters and sixteen hired men, and it offers a fascinating glimpse into Sydney’s past, as well as being a unique hotel from which to explore the city today."
5053230,Unwin's Stores,"The Rocks area is always an interesting place to explore, with many narrow lanes lined with colonial houses, shops and warehouses, some of which have been converted into delightful cafes, restaurants and specialty shops. Take a day to wander around this charming historic precinct and, on your way, you will discover Unwin's Stores in George Street, now a quaint row of specialty shops. This row of 1843 sandstone commercial buildings, with residences above, help to illustrate the layout and nature of the early commercial area and a great deal of the original 1840s fabric survives.

5053251,Parliament House,"This building has played a key role in the history of Australia from an early symbol of colonial government to its long tenure as the first NSW Parliament House. The Parliament House and the Mint Museum are also the two surviving wings of the nation’s first hospital, which was commenced in 1811.  As part of Sydney's oldest remaining complex of public buildings, Parliament House has been at the centre of the history of New South Wales and continues to play a key role in the history of New South Wales as the seat of government today."
5053337,Pyrmont Bridge,"The Pyrmont Bridge spans Darling Harbour, linking the suburbs of Pyrmont to the popular entertainment precinct of Cockle Bay. The bridge, built in 1902, forms a vantage point to view Darling Harbour and it is also the starting point for the City of Sydney Port Walking Tour, which looks at the working life of Sydney's port."
5053339,"Carousel, The","The Darling Harbour Carousel is a rare, complete and intact example of an Edwardian carousel, and one that retains its steam engine and original workings thus demonstrating the methods of construction and operation that are associated with the 'golden age' of carousels (1890s and 1920s).  Imported from England in 1894, this richly decorated carousel has travelled around New South Wales to urban and regional country fairs and events and has given enjoyment to thousands of children. With its galloping horses and chariots, take your children on a rare and exciting ride!"
5053347,St. John the Evangelist Church,"St John the Evangelist Church, Wallerawang, constructed between 1880-1881 in the Victorian Gothic architectural style, is a rare example of a major church building erected by private philanthropy. Erected by Mrs Georgina Abbott as a memorial to her parents, this church was used by Presbyterian and Anglican denominations and was given to both on 18th November 1952. St John the Evangelist Church contains numerous significant moveable objects and artefacts (eg main alter, pews, readers lectern, baptismal font and other associated furnishings, tables and chairs) that were purpose-built for the Church."
5053358,C B Newling Centre,"While admiring the history of Armidale on the heritage drive, you will be able to take in the sights of the CB Newling Centre.

Built in 1928 in the Interwar Georgian Revival Style, the building includes a commanding entrance, with a main staircase leading to the first floor and auditorium, as well as the use of local Australian timbers, terrazzo steps and parquetry floors.  The building is also surrounded by a significant early 1930s landscape that is a rare and surprisingly intact representation of institutional gardening from that period. Featuring a mature parkland with pines, elms and poplars, sheltering rose gardens and other beds that are planted annually, the garden provides a magnificent setting for the Centre as well as being a beautiful place to for visitors to explore."

Chaff (the stems of wheat, oats and other grains) was an important industry at this time as it was the main source of feed for horses. It represents a period between the 1880s and 1940s that saw the dominance of horse-drawn power for rural farm operations and transport generally throughout NSW."
5053622,Port Macquarie Second Burying Ground 1824 - 1886,"The Second Burying Ground is a resting place for at least 1400 people whose lives contributed to and enriched the history and development of a significant area of New South Wales.

5054828,Newington Armament Depot and Nature Reserve,"Newington Armament Depot and Nature Reserve is a remarkable cultural and natural landscape.

From the 1890s the site was important and during the Second World War it was integral to the defence capabilities of the allied forces. It is highly illustrative of the extent of involvement of the Royal Australian Navy and US Navy in the Second World War and the logistics provided by Australia to the Allies.

5054829,The Ben Hall Sites (Collectively),"Ben Hall, a notorious outlaw who terrorised and intimidated; a thief and a thug? Or a gentleman bushranger driven to the wrong side of the law by circumstance? There are layers of truth in his story no doubt that are much more complex than we know but what is certain is that the character Ben Hall captured the imaginations of the people of NSW to such an extent there are commemorative events in his honour even today. Through festivals, poetry, songs, books and websites the story in all its versions lives on. The listing of the Ben Hall Sites celebrates the notoriety of Hall and his significance to the people of NSW. The sites represent the significant aspects of his short three year bushranging career until he was shot to death by police on the banks of Billabong Creek in 1865. The site where he died is located out of Forbes taking the Bogan Gate Road, turning left at Yarrabandai Road, right before Cottons Hill and then follow the signs. The place is marked by signs. Also on Bogan Gate Road is the cemetery where Ben Hall is buried, his grave is marked by a headstone and picket fence. The start of Ben Halls career is debated but the first robbery to which he can be linked was the hold up of the Gold coach at Escort rock. A daring escapade lead by the charismatic outlaw Frank Gardiner in 1862. Escort rock is about 4kms past Eugowra on the road to Orange. The rocky hill can be seen from the small rest area by the side of the road and is marked by a plaque. Another site is the Bushranger hotel which is the only surviving hotel in NSW which has been in continuous use as a hotel that was the subject of attack by bushrangers. On 26 January 1865 Ben Hall, John Gilbert and John Dunn held up the hotel, taking captives. John Dunn shot and killed Constable Samuel Nelson during the raid and a memorial to Constable Nelson can be seen next to the hotel. The other two sites in the list of Ben Hall Sites are privately owned and are not accessible to the public."

5060554,"Great North Road, Between Mt Manning and Wollombi","The Great North Road, surveyed in 1825 and completed in 1836, was constructed using convict labour. Up to 720 convicts - some in chains - worked on the road, which spanned 264 km, connecting Sydney to the settlements of the Hunter Valley. It features spectacular and beautifully preserved examples of stonework, including buttresses, culverts, bridges and twelve metre high retaining walls.   Unfortunately the road was not popular. It was isolated, had no permanent watercourses, and bypassed existing settlements. By 1836, as the few remaining convict gangs were completing the last northern sections of the road, it had been almost entirely abandoned as a route to the Hunter Valley. Coastal steamers became the preferred mode of travel and transportation.  Only 43 km of the road remains undeveloped and relatively intact. Running through and alongside Dharug National Park and Yengo National Park, this section has been named the Old Great North Road. It goes from Wisemans Ferry in the south to Mount Manning (near Bucketty) in the north, and includes the oldest surviving stone bridges in mainland Australia. The road is closed to motor vehicles, but makes a great walk over two or three days - or an exhilarating day's cycle."

5061556,Green Cape Maritime Precinct,"The Green Cape Maritime Precinct is a notable lightstation in the 'highway of lights' that were erected along the NSW coastline during the late 19th century. Although the 1880s was the most productive period for the construction of lighthouses in NSW, the James Barnet-designed Green Cape Lightstation was one of the earliest and most extensive concrete constructions ever attempted in Australia.  The construction of the lightstation was possible because of the development of Bittangabee Bay as a trans-shipment point to receive materials, equipment and labour for the construction. These materials were then taken along a horse-drawn tramway, seven kilometres through the forest to the site of the lightstation.  The lightstation was also the site of the wrecking of the Ly-ee-Moon on the night of May 30, 1886. Considered to be one of Australia's worst maritime disasters, the loss of 71 lives that night was one of the greatest shipwreck tragedies in the state's history. Fifteen people survived the wreck and 24 bodies were recovered and buried in unmarked graves in a small cemetery a short distance from the lightstation."
