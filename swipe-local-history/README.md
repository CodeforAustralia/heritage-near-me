# Swipe Local History

## About
This app is designed to make local history and heritage more appealing.
We're doing this by focussing the content on stories and people instead of places and things.
And by bringing those elements to the front and center of the app.

The app is centered about swiping through interesting stories.
This allows those readers without any idea of their preferences to browse and let serendipity play a role in their interaction with heritage.
