            <div><p>Old Government House is a former country residence used by 10 early governors of New South Wales between 1800 and 1847, located in Parramatta Park in Parramatta, New South Wales, now a suburb of Sydney. It is considered a property of national and international significance as an archaeological resource. It also serves to demonstrate how the British Empire expanded and Australian society has evolved since 1788</p>
             
             <h3>The oldest standing public building in Australia</h3>

        <p>The Crescent is the site where Governor Phillip established Australia's first inland settlement, Parramatta, on 2 November 1788. It is located on the Burramattagal's traditional hunting grounds in present-day Parramatta Park. On the hillside above the crescent-shaped 'alluvial flats contained in a bend in the river,' Parramatta's first building was constructed as part of the fortified camp known as The Redoubt, which was completed in July 1789. The first Government House in Parramatta also stood within The Crescent from 1790 until 1799 when Old Government House was constructed. </p>

        <p>On 24 April 1788 a small party of the colonists led by Governor Phillip continued to explore along the Parramatta River until they came upon The Crescent, so named because a bend in the Parramatta River had cut 'a semi-circular shape into the hill whilst the river formed a [fresh water] billabong below.' The governor made plans to return in spring to establish the town that became Parramatta.</p>

        <p>The first Government House in the colony was built at Sydney Cove in 1788 but the first Government House in Parramatta was built for Governor Phillip in 1790 on the ascending hill of The Crescent. It was a small single-storey cottage measuring 44 feet (approximately 4 m) long and 16 feet (4.9 m) wide made from lath and plaster. Archaeological excavations have revealed remnants of a carriage entrance built by convicts which was also a part of Phillip's original Government House.</p>

        <p>By 1799 Phillip's Government House had deteriorated so much that a new Government House was constructed higher up on the summit of the same hill at The Crescent. This 'new' Government House is now referred to as 'Old Government House.' In 1799 the building only consisted of the main central block as the side extensions that are visible today were added by the Macquaries between 1815 and 1817.</p></div>
