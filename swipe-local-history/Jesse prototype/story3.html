            <blockquote>Places associated with the Rum Rebellion, the only successful armed takeover of government in Australian history</blockquote>
            <div><p>On 26th January 1808, officers and men of the New South Wales Corps marched to Government House in Sydney in an act of rebellion against Governor William Bligh. Bligh was arrested and the colony was placed under military rule. This was the only time in Australian history that a government was overthrown by a military coup. </p>

             <h3>Rum Rebellion Sites</h3>
        <p>The military stayed in power for two years until Lachlan Macquarie, the fifth Governor of NSW, assumed office at the beginning of 1810. The overthrow of Bligh much later became known as the ‘Rum Rebellion’ because the NSW Corps was heavily involved in the trade in rum in the colony and was nicknamed the ‘Rum Corps’. The term 'Rum Rebellion' was not used at the time. The factors leading up to Bligh’s arrest had much less to do with the rum trade and much more to do with a battle for power between the military and civil elites of the colony and the Governor.</p>

        <p>A number of sites associated with the rebellion are listed as heritage items, although not always for their associations with the rebellion. </p>
