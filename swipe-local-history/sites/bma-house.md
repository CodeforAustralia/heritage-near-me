The British Medical Association (BMA) House is one of Sydney's early 150 ft "skyscrapers", dating to the inter- war period (1928-1930) and based on American high rise office buildings of the period. The richly modelled facade (13 storeys in height) to Macquarie Street features a unique blending of Art Deco forms and elements with elaborate decorations including Medieval knights, gargoyles, Australian fauna (koalas) and flora and medical iconography as well as elaborate non-figurative woven-ribbon friezes.

The building is generally used for commercial and professional offices and includes many medical specialists, as it did originally.
