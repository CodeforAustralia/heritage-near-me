Constructed in 1922, this statue of Edward VII is evidence of early 20th century attitudes to the British monarchy.
It terminates the vista along Bridge Street, an example of Sydney's axial town planning.
This statue is also an excellent example of an equestrian statue, which is rare in Sydney.

The life-sized bronze statue is reminiscent of Italian Renaissance examples and is mounted on a sandstone and granite plinth
