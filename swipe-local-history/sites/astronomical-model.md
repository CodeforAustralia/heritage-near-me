This astronomical model consists of a rectangular wooden frame with a circular painted glass panel in the centre that demonstrates the phases of the moon and tides.
It was used at Sydney Observatory, New South Wales, Australia, 1858-1900.

This instrument has the maker's mark of 'Dollond' inscribed on it. The Dollond workshops in England produced quality precision and scientific instruments over a long period of time in the 19th century.
