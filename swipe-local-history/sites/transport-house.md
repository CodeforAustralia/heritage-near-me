Designed by H. E. Godden & Mackey and constructed by H. G. Whittle in 1938, Transport House was used to accommodate the entire organisation of the Department of Road Transport and Tramways; the separate departments previously had occupied space in several locations throughout the city.
The facade is restrained in its use of sandstone and red granite; some statuary by Rayner Hoff was placed here. Inside, however, greater reign was given to colour and detailing in both public and staff spaces including a bold chequered marble floor in the vestibule, red scagliola columns and terrazzo floors in buff, red and green in the Registration Hall and walnut panelling in the Board Room.
